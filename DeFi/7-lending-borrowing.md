# DeFi Lending & Borrowing

A large segment of DeFi services built for enabling borrowing and lending cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner.

- For borrowers:

    Borrowing services allow someone to borrow cryptocurrency from a smart contract in exchange for a collateral in a form of another cryptocurrency as well as the service fee (in a form of interest rate).
    
    The borrower can generally repay the loan at any time and withdraw the deposited collateral. The way these services are built ensures that user collateral always remains under control of a smart contract which is programmed to repay it to the borrower on the loan return.
    
    Generally speaking, borrowing services allow someone to access liquidity without selling their cryptocurrency.
    
- For lenders:

    Lending DeFi services allow cryptocurrency holders to lend their assets to a smart contract and earn interest on the deposited assets.
    
    Many people in possession of cryptocurrencies are able to deposit their assets and earn passive income, with minimal risks.
    
    The interest rate for lending usually is significantly higher than it's for borrowing. This ensures that smart contract are always able to serve both borrower and lenders.
        
Some top DeFi services in that category include [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance/markets), [Aave](https://app.aave.com/home) and [Oasis](https://oasis.app/).
