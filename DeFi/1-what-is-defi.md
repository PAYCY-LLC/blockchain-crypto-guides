# What Is DeFi

The aim of this guide is to onboard someone into Decentralized Finance ecosystem as quickly as possible without going into technicals.

We aim to explain what the new phenomena is, what makes it special, kind of products available, and more importantly how to approach it from an investment point of view.

Decentralized Finance, or DeFi in short, describes a category of financial products which provide financial services to the public but are not controlled by a centralized entity.

> Traditional financial services like deposit accounts, money remittances, stock brokerages etc. are 'centralized'. There is a regulated legal entity that administers user's access to the service and keeps assets on behalf of the user. 
>
> In DeFi, the same type of services are (generally) not governed by a centralized entity, are not regulated, and operate autonomously without the need to be administered by a human.

In general, DeFi services provide users with full control over the assets, and accessible to anyone worldwide, 24/7. DeFi services operate with cryptocurrency, usually Ethereum or some other Ethereum-based tokens.

DeFi services generally built on top of [Ethereum](/token_guides/ethereum.md) blockchain. If you're new to Ethereum then it's recommended for you to go over the [Ethereum guide](/token_guides/ethereum.md) first. A good understanding of Ethereum, Smart Contracts and DApps is essential for this section.

These days, there are DeFi services for cryptocurrency lending, borrowing, trading, derivatives, insurance and much more. Other than dealing with cryptocurrency they work similar to traditional finance counterparts.

## DeFi Attributes

DeFi is an ecosystem, perhaps even a movement, which aims to create a financial system that’s open to everyone and minimizes one’s need to trust and rely on central authorities.

Technologies like the internet, cryptography, and blockchain provided means to build a financial system without the need for central authorities.

Unlike their traditional 'centralized' counterparts, DeFi service usually have following attributes:

- Open Participation

    Anyone worldwide with an internet connection and some cryptocurrency can access and interact with the financial service regardless of location, age, experience, status etc. 
    
- Censorship Resistant

    The service is online and accessible 24/7 from anywhere in the world. Thousands of nodes powering the blockchain ensure constant availability.

- Non-Custodial

    When operating with cryptocurrency assets on DeFi services you always maintain full unconditional control over the assets and can withdraw at any time. No dependence on some entity that acts as custodian of assets.
    
- Trustless

    DeFi services are public and have an open code. The service cannot do anything outside the scope of the pre-programmed rules. It cannot cheat or steal funds. Anyone can lookup the code powering DeFi service and verify that it works exactly as it claims to.

In that regard, the goal of DeFi is to reconstruct the financial system for the whole world in this open way.
    
## DeFi History

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the original decentralized finance systems. Both are controlled by large networks of computers, not central authorities. 

1. Bitcoin was the first blockchain which paved the way for decentralized finance by allowing people to transact in Bitcoin without the need for a third-party to execute that transaction. Today, Bitcoin blockchain handles on average [300K transactions a day](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html#1y).

2. The Ethereum took the idea of transactions further and enabled conditional transactions. It enabled programmers to build complex financial services that are always online, censorship resistant and autonomous. 

3. Over the last few years, Ethereum has attracted a lot of engineers and entrepreneurs building DeFi services. Most blockchain engineers involved in the space now see Ethereum as the best currently available platform for decentralized financial services.

Today, despite some deficiencies Ethereum ecosystem managed to produce a lot of DeFi services operating surprisingly large sums. There are already some DeFi services controlling assets worth more than a billion USD.

In August 2020, the total sum controlled by DeFi has exceeded [4 billion USD](https://defipulse.com) in value.

> Crypto entrepreneurs and engineers now recreate traditional financial instruments in a decentralized architecture, outside of companies’ and governments’ control.

Being a disruptive technology, the upside potential of the industry is extremely high. There a lot of well-financed startups, entrepreneurs, finance people working on DeFi services.

## Building DeFi

The DeFi ecosystem been growing extremely fast. It's difficult to stay on top even for someone involved in the industry on a full-time basis.
 
In essence, DeFi services consist of smart contracts that outline the operational logic of the service. Once that smart contract coded by engineers and added to the Ethereum blockchain it becomes public, permanent and accessible to all.

To give you a better understanding of the process let's outline some essential points to know about how the DeFi services are built, financed and governed nowadays:

- Building

    The open nature of the Ethereum blockchain makes it possible for anyone to evaluate and reuse the code from existing projects.
    
    As a result engineers able to quickly build all kinds of services by utilizing the code powering other DeFi services just like Lego blocks.
    
    All genuine DeFi projects are open source. The open source is a requirement if the project is to be trusted by a community.
    
- Financing

    DeFi projects are decentralized which in many cases mean that service is not directly tied to some legal entity or corporation. It also usually means that service is not really regulated by any government authority or agency.

    To raise funds DeFi projects generally conduct token sales via a process such as ICO (Initial Coin Offering). In simple terms, the ICO is an equivalent of public stock listing (IPO), but a process that is open to all. During the ICO the project sells Ethereum-based token which typically represents the vote/share in that 'to be' DeFi project. 
    
    The ICO takes place on Ethereum blockchain and typically open to anyone, unconditionally. While many solid projects raised funds this way starting from 2016, there were also a lot of ICOs raising funds on empty promises.

- Governance

    As mentioned above, the entities developing DeFi projects try to raise funds through a token sale. ICO is on of such ways, there are several other as well.
    
    It's common for a DeFi token to represent ownership, or some kind of profit share in a service. The ownership of the token usually enables its owner to become a beneficiary owner of the DeFi project.
    
    There are a number of DeFi projects which are currently governed by a geographically-distributed entities which may not know each other. The governance usually takes place via proposals and voting mechanisms.

- Decentralization
