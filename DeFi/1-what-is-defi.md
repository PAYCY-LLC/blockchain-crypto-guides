# What Is DeFi

Let’s start with a brief introduction to Decentralized Finance or DeFi in short.

Decentralized Finance describes a category of financial products which provide financial services to the public.

To better understand DeFi, let's see how decentralized financial services are different from traditional "centralized" ones. 

> Traditional financial services like bank deposit accounts, money remittances, stock brokerages etc. are known as "centralized" financial services. 
> 
> When using a centralized service there is an entity which administers access to the service as well as controls client's assets.
>
> DeFi services are (generally) not governed by a centralized entity, are not regulated, and rely upon pre-programmed algorithms without the need to be administered by a human.
>
> DeFi services operate with cryptocurrency and built on top of censorship-resistant blockchains like Ethereum, ensuring open and censorship-resistant access to anyone. 

Today, there are many emerging DeFi services which starting to provide traditional financial services via this new medium. There are DeFi products which provide interest-based savings, cryptocurrency trading, money remittances, and much more.

Unlike traditional counterparts, these products usually have following attributes:

- Open Participation

    Anyone worldwide with an internet connection and some cryptocurrency can access and interact with the financial service regardless of location, age, experience, status etc. 
    
- Censorship Resistant

    The service is online and accessible 24/7 from anywhere in the world. Thousands of nodes powering the blockchain ensuring constant availability.

- Non-Custodial

    When operating with cryptocurrency assets on DeFi services you always maintain full unconditional control over them and can withdraw them at any time.
    
- Trustless

    Cannot cheat or steal funds. The service cannot do anything outside the scope of the programmed rules.    
    
DeFi is an ecosystem, perhaps even a movement, which aims to create a financial system that’s open to everyone and minimizes one’s need to trust and rely on central authorities.

Technologies like the internet, cryptography, and blockchain provided means to build a financial system without the need for central authorities.

## DeFi History

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the original decentralized finance systems. Both are controlled by large networks of computers, not central authorities.

1. Bitcoin was the first blockchain which paved the way for decentralized finance that allowed anyone to receive, send and hold Bitcoin without third party service providers such as banks.

2. The Ethereum took the idea further and enabled conditional transactions. Specifically, it enabled programmers to build programmable public services with complex logic which operate autonomously without means for someone to interfere. For as long as the Ethereum blockchain is online, these service remain operational and work exactly as intended.

3. Emergence of those systems and subsequent improvements encouraged engineers to build financial services which are:
 
    - cannot cheat
    - transparent
    - distributed
    - open to all
    - censorship-resistant

In just a few years the Ethereum ecosystem is now having a lot of DeFi products operating large sums, in a decentralized manner.

Most of the high net worth projects which are live and already serving the public in the DeFI ecosystem are working on top of the Ethereum blockchain. 

> Crypto entrepreneurs and engineers now recreate traditional financial instruments in a decentralized architecture, outside of companies’ and governments’ control.

In that regard, the goal of DeFi is to reconstruct the financial system for the whole world in this open way.

## On Ethereum Blockchain

Today, term DeFi used as a reference to financial services built on top of [Ethereum](/token_guides/ethereum.md) blockchain or one of its smaller alternatives like EOSIO. 

Ethereum blockchain is a foundational platform for DeFi products. It's a preferred platform for many building DeFi services. Therefore, if you're new to Ethereum then it's recommended for you to go over the [Ethereum guide](/token_guides/ethereum.md) first.
