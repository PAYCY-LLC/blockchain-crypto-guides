# What Is DeFi

Let’s start with a brief introduction to Decentralized Finance or DeFi in short.

Decentralized Finance describes a category of financial products which provide financial services to the public.

Let's see how decentralized financial services are different from traditional "centralized" ones. 

> Traditional financial services like deposit accounts, money remittances, stock brokerages etc. are "centralized". There is a regulated legal entity that administers your access to the service and keeps your assets. 
>
> In DeFi, the same type of services are (generally) not governed by a centralized entity, are not regulated, and able to work without the need to be administered by a human.

DeFi services operate with cryptocurrency, provide users with full control over the assets, and accessible to anyone worldwide, 24/7. 

DeFi services generally built on top of [Ethereum](/token_guides/ethereum.md) blockchain. If you're new to Ethereum then it's recommended for you to go over the [Ethereum guide](/token_guides/ethereum.md) first.

There are DeFi instruments for cryptocurrency lending, borrowing, trading, derivatives, insurance and much more. Other than dealing with cryptocurrency they work similar to traditional finance counterparts.

Unlike their traditional counterparts, DeFi service usually have following attributes:

- Open Participation

    Anyone worldwide with an internet connection and some cryptocurrency can access and interact with the financial service regardless of location, age, experience, status etc. 
    
- Censorship Resistant

    The service is online and accessible 24/7 from anywhere in the world. Thousands of nodes powering the blockchain ensure constant availability.

- Non-Custodial

    When operating with cryptocurrency assets on DeFi services you always maintain full unconditional control over the assets and can withdraw at any time.
    
- Trustless

    DeFi services are public and have open code. The service cannot do anything outside the scope of the pre-programmed rules. It cannot cheat or steal funds.  
    
> To sum up, DeFi is an ecosystem, perhaps even a movement, which aims to create a financial system that’s open to everyone and minimizes one’s need to trust and rely on central authorities.

Technologies like the internet, cryptography, and blockchain provided means to build a financial system without the need for central authorities.

## DeFi History

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the original decentralized finance systems. Both are controlled by large networks of computers, not central authorities. 

1. 2010 : Bitcoin was the first blockchain which paved the way for decentralized finance by allowing people to transact in Bitcoin without the need for a third-party to execute that transaction. Today, Bitcoin blockchain handles on average [300K transactions a day](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html#1y).

2. 2015 : The Ethereum took the idea of transactions further and enabled conditional transactions. It enabled programmers to build complex financial services that are always online, censorship resistant and autonomous. 

3. 2020 : Over the last few years, Ethereum has attracted lots of engineers and entrepreneurs building DeFi services. A lot of engineers see Ethereum as the best currently available platform for decentralized financial services.

Today, despite some deficiencies Ethereum ecosystem managed to produce a lot of DeFi services operating surprisingly large sums. There are already some DeFi services controlling assets worth more than a billion USD.

In that regard, the goal of DeFi is to reconstruct the financial system for the whole world in this open way.

> Crypto entrepreneurs and engineers now recreate traditional financial instruments in a decentralized architecture, outside of companies’ and governments’ control.

The DeFi ecosystem been growing fast. Being a disruptive technology, the upside potential of the industry is extremely high. 

There a lot of well-financed startups, entrepreneurs, finance people working on DeFi services. The engineering salaries in blockchain space are one of the highest in the industry.

## Building DeFi

From engineering perspective, building a DeFi service is not very different from traditional centralized services. 

Engineering aside, there are many other sides of DeFi that make it attractive both for engineers and entrepreneurs. The open nature of the Ethereum blockhain makes it possible for anyone to start building DeFi services without the need to obtain some regulatory approvals.

In practical steps, building DeFi service involves writing a smart contract (or a set of) that outline the operational logic of the service. Once that smart contract added to Ethereum blockchain it becomes public, permanent and accessible to all.

- Open Source
    
    open source: code reuse (lego)

- Fundraising 

    may raise funding through an ICO proce or alike

- Governance

    through token ownership, no lgeal entity etc. those projects may not be governed at all or in a DAO manner

- Decentralization

    various services come with varying degree of decentralization
