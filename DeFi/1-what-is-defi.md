# What Is DeFi

Let’s start with a brief introduction to Decentralized Finance or DeFi in short.

Today, people say DeFI in reference to financial applications built on top of Ethereum or one of its smaller alternatives like EOSIO or Tron blockchain platforms.

## De/Centralized Finance

To better understand DeFi, let's take a look at how traditional "centralized" finance services are different from decentralized ones.

// bank deposits
// money transfers
// stocks / assets
// control/access/custodianship

> Decentralized finance aims to create a financial system that’s open to everyone and minimizes one’s need to trust and rely on central authorities. Technologies like the internet, cryptography, and blockchain give us the tools to collectively build and control a financial system without the need for central authorities. That's the core idea behind Decentralization.

- usually means no regulation
- full security 
- full freedom of action

## History

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the original decentralized systems. Both are controlled by large networks of computers, not central authorities.

1. Bitcoin was the first blockchain which paved the way for decentralized finance that allowed anyone to receive, send and hold Bitcoin without third party service providers such as banks.

2. The Ethereum took the idea further and enabled conditional transactions. Specifically, it enabled programmers to build programmable public services with complex logic which operate autonomously without means for someone to interfere. For as long as the Ethereum blockchain is online, these service remain operational and work exactly as intended.

Emergence of those systems and subsequent improvements encouraged engineers to build financial systems that:
 
 - can't cheat
 - transparent and distributed
 - open and inclusive
 - censorship-resistant.

In just a few years the Ethereum ecosystem is now having a lot of proven DeFi products managing large sums.

Most of the high net worth projects which are live and already serving the public in the DeFI ecosystem are working on top of the Ethereum blockchain. 

> Crypto entrepreneurs and engineers now recreate traditional financial instruments in a decentralized architecture, outside of companies’ and governments’ control.

In that regards, the goal of DeFi is to reconstruct the financial instruments system for the whole world in this open way.
