# DeFi Products

In just a few years DeFi ecosystem managed to grow from zero to a state where decentralized financial services manage cryptocurrency measured in billions USD. 

Below we cover some of the most popular DeFi product categories that already exist and function. These include cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency lending/borrowing services, stablecoins and various derivatives.

> In general, DeFi services operate with cryptocurrency, not regulated, cannot be censored or taken by someone offline.

Other than dealing with cryptocurrency these services provide alternative to traditional financial services but without the means for someone to oversee your access to the service or interfere with your assets.

## 1. Decentralized Exchanges

While there are a number of major [cryptocurrency exchanges](/guides/fundamentals/6-buying-cryptocurrency-basics.md) exist today pretty much all of them are centralized. Centralized exchanges provide ways to buy/sell cryptocurrency with/for fiat currency like USD, EUR etc. 

Centralized exchanges:
 
- support buying/selling a wide range of cryptocurrencies for fiat
- have high liquidity for major cryptocurrencies
- require every user to go through identity verification and KYC/AML checks
- available in some countries, depending on local regulations

The decentralized exchanges (or DEXes) began to emerge fairly recently as the [Ethereum ecosystem](/guides/token_guides/ethereum.md)) started to mature. Ethereum blockchain provided the needed foundational infrastructure for such services.

After just a couple of years, we have a decentralized exchange which average over 100 million worth of USD 24-hour trading volume. These exchanges already serve a large segment of users which are located in countries where access to centralized exchanges restricted or severely limited in functionality.

When trading on a DEX the exchange occurs without having to rely on an entity which acts as intermediary between the buyer and seller. The trades instead are governed by smart contracts which cannot do anything outside the standard feature set.

Unlike the centralized counterparts, DEX enables cryptocurrency trading without any limitations. There are no limits on the amount the user can trade.

> Anyone with some cryptocurrency can trade on a decentralized exchange without the need to go through identity checks or account verification procedures. 
>
> Today DEXes operate solely with cryptocurrency, mainly ETH and Ethereum based tokens, generally without any means to use the fiat currency.

Some popular decentralized exchanges are: 

- [Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/home)
- [Curve Finance](https://curve.fi)
- [Balancer](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap)

Each DEX comes with its own features and unique selling points. While Uniswap may have large selection of trading pairs the Curve Finance can provide better rates when exchanging stablecoins in large volumes. 

We have explored each mentioned exchange in detail in the coming sections dedicated to [decentralized exchanges](/guides/defi/5-decentralized-exchanges.md).

## 2. Liquidity Pools

If you are new to Ethereum or DeFi, liquidity pools is a seemingly complicated concept to understand. 

The first generation of decentralized exchanges been struggling to attract cryptocurrency traders due to low trading volumes for most trading pairs. As a result most people been using centralized exchanges which typically have more people and therefore higher trading volumes.

> Liquidity pools emerged as a solution to increase the trading volume and liquidity on decentralized exchanges. 
>
> These pools are controlled by smart contracts associated with DEXes and offer a new mechanism for creating liquidity on a platform while also allowing investors to earn a yield on their holdings.

In essence, liquidity pools allow cryptocurrency owners to earn additional income from their holdings with limited risks. 

- For cryptocurrency holders: 

    Cryptocurrency holders can deposit their holdings into a liquidity pool belonging to a DEX and earn some cryptocurrency as a result without loosing access to the assets.
    
- For cryptocurrency traders:

    Cryptocurrency traders are able to buy/sell a given cryptocurrency at market price (or close to) at any time without worrying about the liquidity. 
    
Liquidity pools have no listing fees, or other barriers: anyone can invest their cryptocurrency in an existing liquidity pool, or create a new one, and get rewarded for it by the liquidity pool smart contract. The owner can withdraw assets together with earnings from the pool at any time. 

Pretty much all major DEXes including [Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/home) and [Balancer](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/) support creation of liquidity pools and earn some passive income as a result.

For demo purposes, let's assume the user has some Ethereum and [MakerDAO tokens](/guides/token_guides/makerdao.md) and decides to add them into a liquidity pool.

1. The user locks some cryptocurrency assets into a liquidity pool smart contract on a DEX like Uniswap.
3. Smart contract then uses these funds to provide liquidity using user's locked assets.
4. From each trade using user's assets Uniswap pays a 0.3% trading fee (split between all liquidity providers).
5. User able to withdraw deposited funds at any time and claim a portion of the trading fees.

For an in-depth overview, examples, differences between pools and expected profits jump to a section about [DEX liquidity pools](/guides/defi/5-decentralized-exchanges.md). 

Meanwhile, regard liquidity pools as automated instruments that for let cryptocurrency holders earn some passive income from their cryptocurrency.

## 3. Lending Pools

A large segment of DeFi services built to facilitate borrowing and lending cryptocurrencies in a decentralized and reliable manner. 

These services imitate the functionality of traditional lending and borrowing services in a risk free way.

- For borrowers:

    Borrowing services allow someone to borrow cryptocurrency from a smart contract in exchange for a collateral in a form of another cryptocurrency as well as the service fee.
    
    The borrower can generally repay the loan at any time and withdraw the deposited collateral. The user's collateral, usually some cryptocurrency, always remains under control of a smart contract which is programmed to repay it to the borrower on the loan return.
    
    Generally speaking, borrowing services allow someone to access liquidity without having to sell their cryptocurrency. As will be shown later on there are many ways to make use of such services.
    
- For lenders:

    Lending DeFi services allow cryptocurrency holders to lend their assets to a smart contract and earn interest on the deposited assets.
    
    Many people in possession of cryptocurrencies are able to deposit their assets and earn passive income, with minimal risks.
    
    The interest rate for lending usually is higher than it's for borrowing. This ensures that smart contract are always able to serve both borrowers and lenders.
        
Some top DeFi services in that category include [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance/markets), [Aave](https://app.aave.com/home) and [Oasis](https://oasis.app/). The borrowing and lending rates, loan terms and collateral requirements usually vary from one service to another. We'll go over them in detail in [DeFi borrowing and lending](/guides/defi/7-lending-borrowing.md) guide.

## 4. Stablecoins

The term stablecoin refers to a type of cryptocurrency which attempts to peg its market value to some external reference, usually itâ€™s USD, EUR or Gold.

DeFi enabled creation of cryptocurrencies which have a fixed value i.e. equal to 1 USD or say 1 oz (ca. 38 g) of gold. Usually stablecoins appear in a form of an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency token and are built with the help of smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain.

While there are a lot of stablecoins in DeFi ecosystem each comes with its own specifics.

Stablecoins pegged to USD:

- MakerDAO's [DAI](/guides/token_guides/makerdao.md)
- Tether's [USDT](/guides/token_guides/tether.md)

Stablecoins pegged to other assets:

- DGX (equal to 1 gram of gold)
- renBTC (equal to 1 Bitcoin)

Depending on how the stablecoin built it has various mechanisms in place to ensure its price always remains very close to the peg. 

The smart contracts governing stablecoins constantly monitor the price of the target asset and take necessary measures to push the price as close to the target asset as possible. 

> The page [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/) shows the price of a decentralized DAI stablecoin over time. As can be seen on that page the DAI price always remained in close range to 1 USD. 

Not all stablecoins are built as per DeFi principles. 

- The DAI stablecoin is decentralized and fully governed by smart contracts without any privileged parties.

- The Tether's USDT is also a stablecoin built on Ethereum. However, unlike the DAI, it is centralized where certain privileged parties can issue new tokens at will as well as freeze USDT tokens belonging to other users.

So, while there are a lot of stablecoins built on Ethereum not all of them are built per DeFi attributes.

## 5. Derivatives

Decentralized financial derivatives is another category representing a growing segment of DeFi services.

> Derivatives derive their value from the value of the primary financial asset that they are linked to via smart contracts.

Smart contracts enable creation of tokenized derivatives (backed by a collateral) without the need for a third party. Counter party agreements are programmatically encoded, drastically reducing the risk for malicious activity. 
    
This trend has allowed anyone to take advantage of opportunities previously restricted to those with brokerage accounts or specialized knowledge.

Examples:

- [Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io)

    With Synthetix, anyone in the world can gain exposure to financial assets or securities (which are not natively present on Ethereum blockchain) like say like USD, EUR, Bitcoin or stocks (Apple, Tesla, etc) without having to deal with the high frictions of financial regulations.
    
    Synthetix enables creation of tokens (called Synths) which are backed (collateralized) by other cryptocurrency tokens. For instance, there is sBTC cryptocurrency token issued via Synthetix smart contracts: it is a stablecoin that's pegged to Bitcoin.
    
    In order for someone to create an sBTC token the person needs to pass to the smart contract SNX cryptocurrency tokens equivalent to 750% of Bitcoin value. In other words, roughly 7.5 worth of Bitcoin in SNX tokens. Such a high collateral is there to ensure that the value of sBTC never falls below the Bitcoin price.
    
- [Augur](https://augur.net)
    
    Global, no-limit betting platform. Bet how much you want on sports, economics, world events and more.
    
    Each bet position represents an asset that either delivers or not when the event occurs.

The list above is by no means complete but merely some highlights. As DeFi continues to grow expect to see a lot more DeFi services covering all possible use cases.
