# How To DeFi

The only requirements for someone to start engaging with most DeFi services are the working internet and some amount of cryptocurrency. 

There are no age, experience, geographical or any other conditions. DeFi services are open to all, at any time.

Let's go over tools and know-how needed to get you started on a practical level.

- A DeFi service can have multiple websites/apps depending on its popularity. Since smart contracts reside on always-online blockchain anyone can build a graphical gateway to them in a form of a website or a mobile app.

- DeFi services require user to connect to the service using a [non-custodial](/guides/fundamentals/2-wallets-basics.md) cryptocurrency wallet. The wallet is your way to authenticate and connect to the smart contract. Only some non-custodial wallets are currently supporting DeFi services. 

The most common way is to use a [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser and a [Metamask](https://metamask.io) non-custodial wallet addon for Chrome. There are also versions for Firefox, Opera and Brave browsers.

Metamask is not the only wallet that you can use for DeFi, but it's by far the most popular one.

## Getting Started

Once Metamask has been installed, an icon the shape of a fox will appear on the top right-hand corner of your browser.

1. Setup Wallet

    Click on 'Get started' on Metamask site and select the option to create a new wallet.

2. Add Password
   
   The password is a necessary measure in case someone gets access to your browser.
   
3. Backup Private Key

   Metamask will provide you with a unique 12-word representation of your [private key](/guides/fundamentals/3-private-keys-basics.md). As the case with all non-custodial wallets it's crucial for you to [safely backup](/guides/fundamentals/4-safe-storage-basics.md) that key.

4. Fund Metamask

    Finally, deposit some funds from a wallet where you keep your crypto to your Metamask wallet.

After Metamask wallet funded, open the browser and navigate to the DeFi service website you would like to use. 

Once on the DeFi site look for 'connect wallet' button or a similar option. Click on that button and follow prompts.

When you have connected your Metamask wallet you can begin utilize given DeFi service.

## DeFi Risks

Majority of DeFi services operate in non-custodial manner where user communicates directly with the smart contracts that control the service. 

> The users always remain in control of the funds and can withdraw funds from the service at any time.

That said, there are also some caveats which makes DeFi a risky place to keep your assets. 

- Should something go wrong with the smart contract powering the service you use, thereâ€™s no insurance protecting cryptocurrency assets that you deposit into DeFi smart contracts.

- Most DeFi products still considered experimental despite operating with large sums of cryptocurrency assets.

So, when it comes to DeFi, if something goes wrong you're on your own to bear the responsibilities. There is no entity to complain to or ask for compensation should there be an issue.

> DeFi field is just a few years old and potentially there can be undiscovered security issues in the code powering DeFi smart contracts. 

While some major DeFi services go through third-party security audits not all services are able to afford that. This [risk]((https://defirate.com/hacks/)) is present in all DeFi products. 

Therefore, keep the risks in mind and never invest more than you're willing to lose should something go wrong.

There are some DeFi services, like [Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io) which allow DeFi users to get insured against hacks and vulnerabilities.
