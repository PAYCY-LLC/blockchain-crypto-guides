## Stablecoins Explained

The term stablecoin refers to a type of cryptocurrency which attempts to peg its market value to some external reference, usually it’s USD, EUR or Gold.

> DeFi technologies like smart contracts enabled creation of cryptocurrencies which have a fixed value i.e. equal to 1 USD or say 1 oz (ca. 38 g) of gold. 
>
> Depending on how the stablecoin built it has various mechanisms in place to ensure its price always remains very close to the peg. 

While there are a lot of stablecoins in DeFi ecosystem each comes with its own specifics:

- The [DAI](/guides/token_guides/makerdao.md) stablecoin is decentralized and fully governed by smart contracts without any privileged parties.

- The Tether's [USDT](/guides/token_guides/tether.md) is also a stablecoin built on Ethereum. Unlike DAI, it is centralized where certain privileged parties can issue new tokens at will as well as freeze tokens belonging to other users.

So, while there are a lot of stablecoins built on Ethereum not all of them are built per DeFi attributes.
