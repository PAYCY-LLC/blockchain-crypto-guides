# DeFi Explained

The aim of this guide is to onboard someone into Decentralized Finance, or DeFi in short, as quickly as possible without going into technicals.

We aim to give you a clear guidance on:
 
- what DeFi phenomena is
- what makes it special
- what kind of products exist
- how people invest in it

Decentralized Finance, describes a category of products which provide financial services but are not controlled by a centralized entity.

In traditional finance, also called centralized finance, services providers act as intermediaries between the user and service. User's access and participation in the service is conditional and regulated by that service provider. 

- Banks place minimum account balances, withdrawal caps and transfer limits on savings accounts.

- Credit card issuers can cancel your card and service if they see any activity they deem suspicious. 

- Investment opportunities are conditional and exclude most but the wealthiest members of society.

In DeFi, offered services are (generally) not governed by a centralized entity, not regulated, and operate autonomously without the need to be administered by a human.

Technologies like the internet, cryptography, and blockchain provided means to create financial instruments where trust and reliability guaranteed by computer programs removing the need for a human intermediary.

> DeFi is an ecosystem, even a movement, driven by an aim to create a financial system that’s open to everyone and minimizes one’s need to trust and rely on central authorities.

The majority of DeFi services take the form of decentralized apps, more commonly known as DApps, are built on Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, it's recommended to go over the [Ethereum guide](/guides/token_guides/ethereum.md) first. 

> A good understanding of Ethereum, Smart Contracts and DApps is essential to understand material described in this section.

Today there are DeFi services for cryptocurrency lending, borrowing, trading, derivatives, insurance and other financial instruments.

## DeFi Attributes

DeFi services usually built around following principles:

![](./images/defi-attributes-l.png)

- Open To All

    Anyone worldwide with an internet connection and some cryptocurrency can access and interact with the DeFi service regardless of location, age, experience, status etc. 
    
- Censorship Resistant

    DeFi services live on a distributed blockchain, which is accessible 24/7 from anywhere in the world. Thousands of nodes powering the blockchain ensure uninterrupted access to services to anyone worldwide.

- Non-Custodial

    DeFi services operate with cryptocurrency assets. The service user always maintain full unconditional control over the assets. No dependence on other external factors, or some entity that acts as custodian of assets.
    
- Guarantee Trust

    DeFi services are public and have an open code. The service cannot do anything outside the scope of the pre-programmed rules. It cannot cheat, steal or misuse funds. Anyone can verify that it works exactly as it claims to.

- Owned By Many

    In general, DeFi services don't belong to anyone and have no governance mechanism at all, or governed by a geographically distributed group of anonymous entities.

Keeping above in mind, the goal of DeFi is to reconstruct the financial system for the whole world by building open, censorship-resistant, decentralized alternatives.

> A minimum requirement for a DeFi service is to ensure that access to service is unconditional and users always maintain full control over their assets.

If a service built per can freeze other users' funds or censor someone from using the service it cannot be classified as a DeFi service.
    
## DeFi History

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the original decentralized finance systems. Both are controlled by large networks of computers, not central authorities. 

1. Bitcoin was the first blockchain which paved the way for decentralized finance by allowing people to transact in Bitcoin (BTC) without the need for a third-party to execute that transaction. Today, Bitcoin blockchain handles on average [300K transactions a day](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html#1y).

2. The Ethereum took the idea of transactions further and enabled conditional transactions. It enabled programmers to build complex financial services that are always online, censorship resistant and autonomous. 

3. Over the last few years, Ethereum has attracted a lot of engineers and entrepreneurs building DeFi services. Most blockchain engineers involved in the space now see Ethereum as the best available platform for decentralized financial services.

Despite some deficiencies Ethereum ecosystem it managed to produce a number of large DeFi services operating significant sums. In August 2020, the total sum controlled by DeFi has exceeded [4 billion USD](https://defipulse.com) in value.

> Crypto entrepreneurs and engineers now recreate traditional financial instruments in a decentralized architecture, outside of companies’ and governments’ control.

Being a disruptive technology, the upside potential of the industry is extremely high.

## DeFi Today

There are currently a lot of well-financed startups, entrepreneurs, and finance people working in DeFi ecosystem. 

- The total amount of value locked in smart contracts powering DeFi services broke [$4B threshold](https://news.bitcoin.com/total-value-locked-in-defi-surpasses-4-billion-eth-up-over-70-last-30-days/) in August 2020.

- While $4B may seem like a large amount of money to an individual, it’s only a tiny fraction of the amount locked in centralized finance counterparts.

- In Aug 2020, the market cap for all major cryptocurrency projects was at about 300B total, where top DeFi services accounted for [less than 10%](https://defimarketcap.io) of that.

While we can’t necessarily expect DeFi to retain that level of growth, there’s a strong momentum. Growing number of people are getting interested in digital assets that work in a decentralized and private manner.

Below is a basic overview of how building, financing and governance of DeFi services takes place:

- All genuine DeFi projects expected to have open source code and free to reuse by public. Such status quo speeds up building by letting engineers reuse the code from other projects.
        
- To raise funds, DeFi projects generally conduct so called anonymous token sale via a process such as ICO (Initial Coin Offering) or similar. During the ICO the project sells a specific cryptocurrency token which may represent the governance weight or profit share in that DeFi project. 

- DeFi projects usually governed by a geographically-distributed entities which may not even know each other. The governance usually takes place via proposals and voting mechanisms.
