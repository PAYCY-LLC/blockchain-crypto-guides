# DeFi Explained

The aim of this guide is to onboard someone into Decentralized Finance ecosystem as quickly as possible without going into technicals.

We aim to give you a clear guidance on what that new phenomena is, what makes it special, what kind of products exist, and more importantly how to approach it from an investment point of view.

Decentralized Finance, or DeFi in short, describes a category of products which provide financial services but are not controlled by a centralized entity.

> Traditional financial services i.e. deposit accounts, money remittances, stock brokerages etc. are centralized. 
>
> There is always a regulated service provider entity that administers user's access to the service and keeps assets on behalf of the user.

In traditional finance services providers act as intermediaries between the user and service. As a result user's access and participation in the service is conditional and regulated by that intermediary entity. 

- Banks place minimum account balances, withdrawal caps and transfer limits on savings account.

- Credit card issuers can cancel your card and service if they see any activity they deem suspicious. 

- Both banks and credit cards providers can freeze accounts without disclosing the reason.

- Offshore banks may seize uninsured savings in times of economic uncertainty.

- Investment opportunities are often conditional and exclude most but the wealthiest members of society.

In DeFi, the same type of services are (generally) not governed by a centralized entity, not regulated, and operate autonomously without the need to be administered by a human.

DeFi provides users with full control over the assets, and typically accessible to anyone worldwide, 24/7. DeFi services operate with cryptocurrency, usually Ethereum or some other Ethereum-based tokens.

> The majority of DeFi services take the form of decentralized apps, more commonly known as DApps. 

DeFi services usually built on top of Ethereum blockchain. Thus, if you're new to Ethereum then it's recommended for you to go over the [Ethereum guide](/guides/token_guides/ethereum.md) first. A good understanding of Ethereum, Smart Contracts and DApps is essential to understand material described in this section.

Today there are DeFi services for cryptocurrency lending, borrowing, trading, derivatives, insurance and other financial instruments people are used to. Other than being decentralized and dealing with cryptocurrency these services work similar to traditional finance counterparts.

> DeFi is an ecosystem, perhaps even a movement, driven by an aim to create a financial system that’s open to everyone and minimizes one’s need to trust and rely on central authorities.

Technologies like the internet, cryptography, and blockchain provided means to build an open and reliable financial system without the need for central authorities or some kind of agencies to mediate. These technologies enable creation of financial instruments where trust and reliability guaranteed by computer programs removing the need for a human intermediary.

## DeFi Attributes

Unlike their traditional centralized counterparts, DeFi services usually (not always) built around following principles:

- Open (Unconditional)

    Anyone worldwide with an internet connection and some cryptocurrency can access and interact with the financial service regardless of location, age, experience, status etc. 
    
- Censorship Resistant

    DeFi services live on a blockchain, which is accessible 24/7 from anywhere in the world. Thousands of nodes powering the blockchain ensure constant availability and access to services that reside on it to anyone worldwide.

- Non-Custodial

    When operating with cryptocurrency assets on DeFi services you always maintain full unconditional control over the assets without passing custodianship. No dependence on some entity that acts as custodian of assets.
    
- Guarantee Trust

    DeFi services are public and have an open code. The service cannot do anything outside the scope of the pre-programmed rules. It cannot cheat, steal or misuse funds. Anyone can lookup the code powering given DeFi service and verify that it works exactly as it claims to and cannot do anything outside its scope.

- Governed by Community

    In general, DeFi services are governed by a distributed group of entities where each entity has a vote weight proportional to their holdings of the governance token specific to that service. Some simpler DeFi services do not have any governance mechanism at all. More on that below.

Keeping above in mind, the goal of DeFi is to reconstruct the financial system for the whole world by building open and decentralized alternatives.

While most DeFi projects are label themselves as 'decentralized' the degree of decentralization will vary from one service to another, depending on how it's built.

There are a number of DeFi services built on Ethereum which label itself as decentralized but at the same time operate and governed like a centralized service. A project may score high on some attributes above and rank poorly on others.

> There are currently no 100% decentralized financial platforms on the market.

To be considered a DeFi service, a DApp has to exhibit one or more decentralized characteristics, and has to operate in a spirit of decentralization.

It's expected for a DeFi service to ensure that users always maintain unconditional control over the assets.

For instance, someone may build a service on Ethereum that implements some DeFi attributes but at the same time keeps a 'special' admin account accessible only to the service provider and can freeze other users' funds or censor someone from using the service. Such services cannot be classified as DeFi service.
    
## DeFi History

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the original decentralized finance systems. Both are controlled by large networks of computers, not central authorities. 

1. Bitcoin was the first blockchain which paved the way for decentralized finance by allowing people to transact in Bitcoin (BTC) without the need for a third-party to execute that transaction. Today, Bitcoin blockchain handles on average [300K transactions a day](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html#1y).

2. The Ethereum took the idea of transactions further and enabled conditional transactions. It enabled programmers to build complex financial services that are always online, censorship resistant and autonomous. 

3. Over the last few years, Ethereum has attracted a lot of engineers and entrepreneurs building DeFi services. Most blockchain engineers involved in the space now see Ethereum as the best available platform for decentralized financial services.

Despite some deficiencies Ethereum ecosystem it managed to produce a number of large DeFi services operating significant sums. In August 2020, the total sum controlled by DeFi has exceeded [4 billion USD](https://defipulse.com) in value.

> Crypto entrepreneurs and engineers now recreate traditional financial instruments in a decentralized architecture, outside of companies’ and governments’ control.

Being a disruptive technology, the upside potential of the industry is extremely high.

## Building DeFi

The DeFi been growing extremely fast. There are currently a lot of well-financed startups, entrepreneurs, and finance people working in DeFi ecosystem. It's difficult to stay on top even for someone involved in the industry on a full-time basis.
 
In essence, DeFi services consist of smart contracts that outline the operational logic of the service. Once that smart contract coded by engineers and added to the Ethereum blockchain it becomes public, permanent and accessible to all.

To give you a better understanding of the DeFi development process let's outline some essential points about how the DeFi services are built, financed and governed:

- Building

    The open nature of the Ethereum blockchain makes it possible for anyone to evaluate and reuse the code from existing projects.

    All genuine DeFi projects are open source. The open source is a requirement if the project is to be trusted by a community.
        
    As a result engineers working on DeFi products are able to quickly assemble all kinds of services by utilizing the code powering other DeFi products.
   
- Financing

    DeFi projects are decentralized which in many cases mean that service is not directly tied to some legal entity or corporation. It also usually means that service is not really regulated by any government authority or agency.

    To raise funds, DeFi projects generally conduct so called token sale via a process such as ICO (Initial Coin Offering) or similar. In simple terms, the ICO is an equivalent of public stock listing (IPO), but a process that is open to all and hassle-free. During the ICO the project sells a project-specific Ethereum token which typically represents the vote weight or profit share in that DeFi project. 
    
    The ICO takes place on Ethereum blockchain and typically open to anyone, unconditionally. Anyone in possession of Ethereum or some other cryptocurrency can typically invest in those projects by buying the token during the sale. While many solid projects raised funds this way, there were also a lot of ICOs raising funds on empty promises.

- Governance

    As mentioned above, the entities working on DeFi projects raise funds through an ICO or alike token sale. The ownership of the token usually enables its owner to become a beneficiary of the DeFi project.
    
    There are a number of DeFi projects which are currently governed by a geographically-distributed entities which may not even know each other. The governance usually takes place via proposals and voting mechanisms.

So, that's a basic overview of how building, financing and governance of DeFi services take place.

## Size Of DeFi

Decentralized finance is still a small but fast-growing industry:

- The total amount of value locked in smart contracts powering DeFi services broke [$4B threshold](https://news.bitcoin.com/total-value-locked-in-defi-surpasses-4-billion-eth-up-over-70-last-30-days/) in August 2020.

- While $4B may seem like a large amount of money to an individual, it’s only a tiny fraction of the amount locked in centralized finance counterparts which measured in trillions.

- In Aug 2020, the market cap for all major cryptocurrency projects been valued at about 300B total, where top DeFi services accounted for less than 10% of that. The page [here](https://defimarketcap.io) lists top DeFi services by market cap. 

While we can’t necessarily expect DeFi to retain that level of growth, there’s a strong momentum as more and more people grow interested in digital assets and new ways to engage with financial instruments in a decentralized, unconditional and private manner.
