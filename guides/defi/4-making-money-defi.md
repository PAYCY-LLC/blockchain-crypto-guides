# Earning on DeFi

Given that you have a basic understanding of what DeFi is and how it works let's look at various ways early adopters earn on DeFi ecosystem.

Below we explore currently popular ways to increase the capital in DeFi ecosystem, from simple open-to-all methods to advanced techniques that require programming.

The purpose of this guide is illustrate currently popular ways to earn on DeFi ecosystem. In other words, we'll try to highlight the main incentives that attract people to DeFi. 

The information presented here, is purely for educational purpose and none of the statements below should be taken as financial advice.

## 1. Investing in DeFi

The most common and straightforward way is investing in DeFi Projects while they are still small. The idea is to buy when project is young and cash out once it grows. 

Being a new and booming ecosystem with a lot of capital there are a lot new projects appearing daily. As covered in [DeFi Explained](/guides/defies/defi/1-defi-explained.md), governance and ownership of many DeFi services are tied to the ownership of the specific token.

- These DeFi cryptocurrency tokens are generally limited in supply from start and represent the ownership of the project or profit share. These tokens are publicly tradable, just like stocks, primarily on [DEXes](/guides/defies/defi/5-decentralized-exchanges.md) and [centralized exchanges](/fundamentals/6-buying-cryptocurrency-basics.md).

- On project launch the price of the token is usually low reflecting the low interest and demand from the market. Typically, as service starts attracting people the demand for the token goes up pushing the price higher. 

- Most DeFi projects require the token as a payment to the financial services the project provides. This gives to the token its underlying value and creates even more demand for the token as the project grows and demand for project services increases.

So, anyone who invests in solid early stage projects may potentially see significant returns as project grows. A majority of DeFi 'success stories' have seen their token value appreciate up to [50 times](https://defimarketcap.io) the initial token sale price.

> At its core, DeFi ecosystem challenges traditional finance services which currently hold a lot of the world's finances. 
>
> In that regard, as money continues flowing from traditional finance to DeFi, the upside potential for Ethereum and the DeFi remains enormous.

The basic strategy here is to learn how to find and evaluate promising DeFi projects in early or mid stages. 

> Finding good, reliable, decentralized projects that can deliver requires a lot of research and a fairly solid understanding of the ecosystem.

The most important skill you can develop for engaging with DeFi is due diligence. Once you know how to research platforms and projects, youâ€™ll be able to protect yourself from scams and embarrassing mistakes. 

Here are a few tips on how to research DeFi projects for investment purposes:

- Familiarize yourself with fundamentals of storing and using cryptocurrencies.
- Get familiar with how DeFi services operate.
- Make sure you understand what you are buying and what the risks are.
- Look for well-respected sources before making any financial decisions.
- Be wary of anything that make promises that seem 'too good to be true'.
- Don't ever invest more than you can afford to lose!

Keep in mind that over the long run majority of DeFi projects are going to fail. Moreover, there are a lot of scam projects built for the sole purpose of tricking people in buying a token which represents no value and cannot be used for anything.

## 2. Trading DeFi

Due to highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies and DeFi tokens in particular, a lot of cryptocurrency traders are trying to make money from that.

> Trading cryptocurrency is highly risky, speculative and prone to manipulation.

It's not uncommon for some DeFi token to change 10% over the 24-hour period as a result of some unconfirmed rumor or for no apparent reason at all. 

- Decentralized exchanges where these tokens are traded are open to anyone worldwide unconditionally. There are no geographical, age or any other requirements.

- Some DeFi services provide instruments to trade in amounts significantly higher than trader's holdings. A decentralized exchange [dYdX](/guides/defies/defi/5-decentralized-exchanges.md) provides ways to trade with a 5-10x leverage. 

- There are also instruments enabling user to borrow large amounts of cryptocurrency as loan and use it for trading. In DeFi, you can borrow money without anyone even asking for your name.

- More experienced traders design automated trading bots (programs) which monitor DeFi markets in real time and act when conditions are right. 

- A trading bots can be easily programmed to take out an instant on-demand loan from another smart contract and repay right after the trade executed.

- Traders can and frequently do go short on hyped/overpiced DeFi tokens.

Keep in mind that while some people make a lot of money in trading DeFi tokens it's likely even more people are loosing. 

Active trading is generally for more advanced users, typically with experience on stock or forex markets.

## 3. Yield Farming

It's a shorthand used to describe strategies where cryptocurrency assets are temporarily placed at the disposal of some smart contract that earns the owner even more cryptocurrency. 

In DeFi the services are largely funded by strangers on the internet. Generally, newly launched DeFi projects do not have any assets locked in them. The assets are accumulated as more and more users engage with services provide by these DeFi smart contracts.

For instance:

- A cryptocurrency lending DeFi service needs lenders willing to lend their cryptocurrency, so that borrowers are able to borrow it. 

- A DeFi insurance service needs insurers willing to put their cryptocurrency assets into a decentralized insurance pool in exchange for regular payouts from insured entities.

- A liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap won't work if there is no one willing to put his assets into a smart contract that acts as automated market maker.

So, liquidity is the chief concern of all these different products. To attract liquidity, the startups behind DeFi applications come up with clever ways to incentivize those with cryptocurrency to use a service and earn premium. 

This 'yield farming' concept enabled cryptocurrency investors to earn passive income on their investments at rates significantly better than that of traditional finance.

Common methods:

- Liquidity Pools

    Decentralized exchanges and other public facing DeFi services require liquidity to be usable. In other words, when someone wants to buy a cryptocurrency on a decentralized exchange (DEX) there should be someone online willing to sell it.
    
    To solve liquidity problems DEXes incentivize cryptocurrency owners to enroll as liquidity providers via liquidity pools. Users looking for passive income pay potentially deposit some amount of crypto assets into a smart contract which uses these funds to serve buy/sell orders originating from DEX. Liquidity providers earn resulting trading fees.

    Most liquidity pools are built in a way where user remains in control of the assets and can withdraw his/her share from the pool at any time. There is no custody risk. There are many models exist for [liquidity pools](/guides/defies/defi/6-liquidity-pools.md) which are covered in great detail in coming sections. 
    
    As will be explained the profitability of the liquidity pool depends on various factors and tends to change on a real-time basis. Sometimes participation in a liquidity pool may be even unprofitable.
    
- Lending Pools

    There are a number of major DeFi services which facilitate cryptocurrency lending and borrowing services in non-custodial manner.
    
    Those with crypto assets can lend their assets to a DeFi service (smart contract) at given interest rates. At the same time these services allow others to borrow cryptocurrency at higher rates. 
    
    Practically speaking, someone can potentially borrow crypto assets from one service and then invest them in some profitable liquidity pool. The user can then make a profit given that earnings from the liquidity pool outweighs the cost of borrowing.
    
    In the coming sections we are looking in depth at major [DeFi lending pools](/guides/defies/defi/7-lending-borrowing.md).

## 4. Other

The classification above mean to provide a basic overview of the type of DeFi services that currently exist. As DeFi continues to grow expect to see more creative ways to put your crypto assets to work.

While the categories above account for most DeFi services, there are also those which do not belong to any. Let's go over some of those service below:
    
- Prediction Markets

    Prediction markets allow users to bet on sports, economics, world events and more. One of the most popular DeFi services in that category is [Augur](https://augur.net).
    
- Flash Loans
    
    There are smart contracts which can lend users large amounts without collateral, provided they pay back the loan within the same transaction (i.e. immediately). 
        
    Someone may ask, why take out a loan if you have to pay it back immediately? There are a few legitimate applications for flash loans i.e. refinancing crypto loans, or for arbitrage opportunities on a decentralized exchange.
        
The concept of flash loans is fairly advanced to grasp and therefore no worries if you don't understand it yet. We will go over some real life examples in later section.
    
> It should be noted that DeFi services are inter-operable. For instance, a person may borrow some money on one DeFi service, then pass the money to another service for something else, then to another and another. 
>
> The aim is to end up with more funds at the end of the transaction, repay the borrowed loan at the very end of the transaction and earn some profit as a result. All of that in a single transaction.

This interoperability enabled more experienced and technical users utilize DeFi services as lego building blocks and create complex transactions which go far beyond the standard 'transfer X tokens FROM address1 TO address2'. 

It's fine if that concept appears somewhat unclear to you at this point. You don't need to understand that at this point.
