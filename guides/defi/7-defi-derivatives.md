## 5. Derivatives

Decentralized financial derivatives is another category representing a growing segment of DeFi services.

> Derivatives derive their value from the value of the primary financial asset that they are linked to via smart contracts.

Smart contracts enable creation of tokenized derivatives (backed by a collateral) without the need for another entity other than smart contract.

This trend has allowed anyone to take advantage of opportunities previously restricted to those with brokerage accounts or specialized knowledge.

Some Examples:

- [Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io)

    With Synthetix, anyone in the world can gain exposure to financial assets or securities (which are not natively present on Ethereum blockchain) like say like USD, EUR, Bitcoin or stocks (Apple, Tesla, etc) without having to deal with the high frictions of financial regulations.
    
    Synthetix enables creation of tokens (called Synths) which are backed (collateralized) by other cryptocurrency tokens. For instance, there is sBTC cryptocurrency token issued via Synthetix smart contracts: it is a stablecoin that's pegged to Bitcoin.
    
    In order for someone to create an sBTC token the person needs to pass to the smart contract SNX cryptocurrency tokens equivalent to 750% of Bitcoin value. A high collateral is there to ensure that the value of sBTC never falls below the Bitcoin price.
    
- [Augur](https://augur.net)
    
    Global, no-limit betting platform. Bet how much you want on sports, economics, world events and more.
    
    Each bet position represents an asset that either pays or not when the event occurs.
    
As DeFi continues to grow expect to see a lot of DeFi services covering entire derivatives market.
