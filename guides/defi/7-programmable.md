# Programmable DeFi

account for most DeFi services, there are many other interesting projects. Let's go over some of those service below:

- Flash Loans
    
    There are smart contracts which can lend users large amounts without collateral, provided they pay back the loan within the same transaction (i.e. immediately). 
        
    Someone may ask, why take out a loan if you have to pay it back immediately? There are a few legitimate applications for flash loans i.e. refinancing crypto loans, or even for arbitrage opportunities on a decentralized exchange.
        
The concept of flash loans is fairly advanced to grasp and therefore no worries if you don't understand it yet. We will go over some real life examples in later section.
    
> It should be noted that DeFi services are inter-operable. For instance, a person may borrow some money on one DeFi service, then pass the money to another service for something else, then to another and another. 
>
> The aim is to end up with more funds at the end of the transaction, repay the borrowed loan at the very end of the transaction and earn some profit as a result. All of that in a single transaction.

This interoperability enabled more experienced and technical users utilize DeFi services as lego building blocks and create complex transactions which go far beyond the standard template like transferring tokens from one address to another. 

It's fine if that concept appears somewhat unclear to you at this point.
