### 2. Curve Finance DEX

[Curve Finance](https://curve.fi) is a decentralized, Uniswap-like exchange but built specifically for [stablecoins](/guides/defi/8-stablecoins.md).

Curve has a lot of trading volume, frequently exceeding over 50 million USD in [trading volume](https://www.curve.fi/dailystats). 

For traders:

- Curve's uniques selling point comes from its trading algorithm which provides better prices when buying or selling large amount of cryptocurrency stablecoins.

- There is a 0.04% fee for each trade.

For liquidity providers:

- Curve's liquidity pools typically provide better return on investments than pools on Uniswap.

- Curve's liquidity pools can lend spare funds to external [DeFi lending](/guides/defi/7-lending-borrowing.md) services and earn liquidity providers passive income even when there is no trading activity. Some liquidity pools do not use any lending protocols.

- The DEX trading fees are split between liquidity providers.

- Curve liquidity pools do not require liquidity provider to deposit all pool tokens. The provider can just deposit one stablecoin, it then gets split between each token in the pool.

Curve DEX has a governance token CRV which provides [additional perks](https://guides.curve.fi/crv-launches-curve-dao-and-crv/) when interacting with Curve services including voting capabilities on important decisions.
