## Uniswap in Simple Terms

[Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/home) is a peer-to-peer, decentralized cryptocurrency exchange to trade Ethereum and Ethereum-based tokens without a risk of fraud.

To this day still one of the biggest DEXes with [over 100 million](https://migrate.uniswap.info/home) in 24-hour trading volume.

For traders:

- When trading on Uniswap traders may see significant price slippage (deviation from market price) for large orders. In other words, trading very large amounts of a token will have significantly less favorable price than when trading smaller amounts.

- Trading fee is 0.03%

For liquidity providers:

- Uniswap uses a simple math formula and tokens available in its liquidity pool to determine price and execute trades. An overview of this mechanics can be found [here](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works) and [here](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/core-concepts/swaps/).

- Anyone can create a liquidity pool for any Ethereum-based ERC20 token on Uniswap, even if the given token not yet listed on exchange.

The Uniswap can be accessed through its front-end at [uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org/). Uniswap doesn't have any native project token associated with the project.
