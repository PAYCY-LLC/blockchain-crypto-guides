# Uniswap in Simple Terms

[Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/home) is a peer-to-peer, decentralized cryptocurrency exchange to trade Ethereum and Ethereum-based tokens. 

Uniswap is one of the first awaited DeFi services to emerge out of the Ethereum

- Uniswap smart contracts today manage hundreds of millions worth of cryptocurrency in autonomous and decentralized manner.

- it's considered as one of genuinely decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Exchange operators cannot censor service users nor shut it down.

- the exchange has the highest trading volume among all decentralized exchanges as well as exceeds many centralized exchanges.
    
- lists a lot of cryptocurrency trading pairs and has a free token listing policy, allowing anyone to list any token and provide liquidity for it.

- uses a simple math formula and tokens available in its liquidity pool to determine price of listed assets and execute trades. An overview of this mechanics can be found [here](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works) and [here](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/core-concepts/swaps/)

- has two versions, Uniswap V1 and newer Uniswap V2. As it was built per deFi principles it's not possible for Uniswap to shut down earlier versions. 

- Uniswap V3 is in the works aimed at further improving various elements of the exchange. 
    
Today, Uniswap is one of the biggest DEXes with [over 100 million](https://migrate.uniswap.info/home) in 24-hour trading volume.

## Traders

The Uniswap trading interface can be accessed through its front-end at [uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap).

- there is a 0.03% service fee for traders to execute transaction on Uniswap.

- it's generally cheaper to trade between Ethereum's native ETH and some Ethereum ERC20 tokens, then exchanging one ERC20 token to another.

When trading on Uniswap traders may see significant price slippage (deviation from market price) for larger orders. 

> Price slippage depends on the amount of liquidity available for a given pair in its liquidity pool. 

Keep that in mind when trying to buy or sell a large amount of cryptocurrency on Uniswap. Page [here](https://uniswap.info/pairs) shows all trading pairs on Uniswap along with liquidity pool for each.

Trading pairs with more liquidity in its liquidity pools will provide better price for larger orders then pairs with less liquidity in its pool.

## Liquidity Providers

Uniswap was one of the first projects to introduce automated market making algorithm via liquidity pools.

- each trading pair on Uniswap has its own liquidity pool. Anyone can create a liquidity pool on Uniswap or join an existing one.

- to join liquidity pool user required to deposit two tokens that are involved in a trading pair. A [ETHUSDT](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x0d4a11d5eeaac28ec3f61d100daf4d40471f1852) trading pair will require both ETH and USDT tokens as deposit.

- liquidity provider needs to deposit both tokens in equal amounts, taking into account current market prices of tokens.

- liquidity providers earn from trading fees, proportionally to the size of the deposited assets. 

- on deposit liquidity providers receive pool specific tokens which represent the ownership of certain amount of assets in the pool.

- liquidity provider may pull assets along with earnings out of the pool at any time.

And while Curve has similar benefits as Uniswap for liquidity providers, it’s not subject to the degree of “impermanent loss.” That’s because Curve only trades between stablecoins, whilst Uniswap trades directly against ETH. And ETH’s volatility can wreak havoc on Uniswap’s liquidity providers. 


## Token

Uniswap doesn't have any native project token associated with the project. As a result there is no such thing as governance or any voting mechanisms.
