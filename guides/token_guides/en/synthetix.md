# Synthetix In Simple Terms

Synthetix is a protocol for trading synthetic assets (Synths) on Ethereum, where “Synths” are ERC-20 token representations of crypto assets, stocks, fiat currencies, precious metals, and other forms of assets. 

- sBTC
- sUSD
- sETH
- sAUD
- sXAU

Synths simply copy the price of an asset and leave behind all of its other properties as the sole purpose of the Synthetix system is to allow users to bet on the price of an asset without holding the actual asset.

Synthetix was founded in 2017 by Kain Warwick, co-founder and CEO of Blueshyft, a retail payment network of more than 1,250 locations across Australia. 

Major backers of Synthetix include BlockTower, BlockAsset, GBIC, AlphaBlock Investments, and Astronaut Capital.

## SNX Token

The Synthetix Network Token (SNX) token is a decentralised cryptoasset, whose intrinsic value is derived from the fees generated in the network it collateralises. 

The SNX token is used as collateral to mint Synths from the platform at a ratio of 5:1(500% collateralisation ratio) . 

Its value is derived from the fees generated in the network, as the SNX token is used as collateral to mint Synths from the platform at a ratio of 5:1 (500% collateralization ratio). 

In other words, SNX holders can lock up their SNX as collateral for minting Synths and earn rewards paid out in SNX from transaction fees curated from trading between different synthetic assets on Synthetix.Exchange.

All in all, the token economics of SNX comes down to using transaction fees as an incentive to ensure that the Synthetic Network and its Synths are always over-collateralized and solvent.

The SNX token incentivizes token holders to fulfil two functions:

- To provide the system with collateral to generate Synths

- To participate in the stabilisation of the Synths price relative to the underlying pegged asset.

Users of the Synths token pay the owners of the SNX token for collateralising and stabilising the system.

SNX holders that mint Synths by locking their SNX token as collateral will be rewarded from transaction fees generated by circulating Synths, currently set at 0.3% from trading between different synthetic assets on Synthetix.Exchange.

## Synths

Synthetix allows synthetic assets (Synths) to be minted against the value of SNX tokens. 

- This is done by locking SNX into a smart contract as collateral at a ratio of 750% to the Synths minted. For example, this means that if 1000 SNX is locked at a value of $0.10 USD, 13.3 sUSD can be minted against it. 

- 750% has been chosen to provide ample protection against price fluctuations.

- depending on the collateralization ratio users receive fees generated by Synth transactions. If ratio drops below 750%, user will not be able to claim fees until it brought back above 750%. This is to incentivise SNX holders from maintaining the entire Network Collateralisation Ratio (i.e. value of total locked SNX against value of total Synths) as well as keeping Synth prices stable.

SNX holders are incentivized to stake their tokens and mint Synths in several ways. 

- Firstly, there are exchange rewards. These are generated whenever someone exchanges one Synth to another (i.e. on Synthetix.Exchange). Each trade generates an exchange fee that is sent to a fee pool, available for SNX stakers to claim their proportion each week. This fee is between 10-100 bps (0.1% - 1%, though typically 0.3%), and will be displayed during any trade on Synthetix.Exchange. 

- The other incentive for SNX holders to stake/mint is SNX staking rewards, which comes from the protocol’s inflationary monetary policy. From March 2019 to August 2023, the total SNX supply will increase from 100,000,000 to 260,263,816, with a weekly decay rate of 1.25% (from December 2019). These SNX tokens are distributed to SNX stakers weekly on a pro-rata basis provided their collateralisation ratio does not fall below the target threshold.

- Supply of Synths can adjust to the demand, therefore making the network scalable with increased demand for Synths while being flexible to reduced demand of Synths

Synthetix recently launched the first synthetic Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain:

- This release allows Ethereum users to gain non-custodial exposure to Bitcoin, which means they don’t need to trust an institution or protocol to hold the underlying asset. 

- The launch comes as part of a wider release of more synthetic assets, including silver and a variety of fiat currencies.

There are three methods to maintain the Synth peg:

- Arbitrage: 

    SNX stakers have created debt by minting Synths, so if the peg drops they can now profit by buying sUSD back below par and burning it to reduce their debt, as the Synthetix system always values 1 sUSD at $1 USD.

- sETH liquidity pool on Uniswap: 

    each week, a portion of the SNX added to the total supply through the inflationary monetary policy is distributed as reward to people providing sETH/ETH liquidity on Uniswap. This has incentivised liquidity providers to collectively create the largest liquidity pool on Uniswap (at time of writing), allowing traders to purchase Synths to start trading or sell Synths to take profits.

- SNX auction: 

    Synthetix is currently trialling a new mechanism with the dFusion protocol (from Gnosis) in which discounted SNX is sold at auction for ETH, which is then used to purchase Synths below the peg.

## Minting Synths

SNX stakers incur a ‘debt’ when they mint Synths. This debt can increase or decrease independent of their original minted value, based on the exchange rates and supply of Synths within the network. 

For example:

- if 100% of the Synths in the system were synthetic Bitcoin (sBTC), which halved in price, the debt in the system would halve, and each staker’s debt would also halve. 

- This means in another scenario, where only half the Synths across the system were sBTC, and BTC doubled in price, the system’s total debt—and each staker’s debt—would increase by one quarter. 

In this way, SNX stakers act as a pooled counterparty to all Synth exchanges; stakers take on the risk of the overall debt in the system. 

They have the option of hedging this risk by taking positions external to the system. By incurring this risk and enabling trading on Synthetix.Exchange stakers earn a right to fees generated by the system.

Backing synthetic asset and stablecoin in this way provides full on-chain transparency over how many Synths have been issued against the available collateral. 

This provides a solid base for confidence in the solvency of the cryptoasset backed network built upon it.
