# Balancer in Simple Terms

[Balancer](https://balancer.exchange/) is a newer DEX that launched in March 2020 that supports trading Ethereum-based cryptocurrency tokens.

> Balancer is a very new protocol. Although we are taking every precaution and doing extensive audits, this is still very much a beta product. Use small amounts of funds to start.

For traders:

- Balancer able to provide lower trading fees for various pairs due to some incentives for liquidty providers to keep the fees low.

For liquidity providers:

- Just like Curve and Uniswap, Balancer has a custom mechanism for liquidity pools.

- One of the key uniques selling points of Balancer lies in ability to setup personal index fund without undertaking complex re-balancing actions.

- Balancer recently introduced its native governance tokens called BAL which is distributed to liquidity providers.

- The lower the pool fees, the more BAL the pool receives. The higher the trading fees, the less BAL the pool receives. Ultimately, this creates a rather elegant design as pool creators (as well as liquidity providers) will have to factor in whether they’d prefer to play the short-game and potentially earn higher trading fees or play the long-game by minimizing trading fees to maximize their BAL earnings.

- Balancer is permissionless in that the pools cannot be censored nor can the smart contracts be edited or shut down once they’ve been activated. 

Balancer liquidity pools:

- Private Pools: The creator of the pool has full permissions and only he/she can contribute liquidity. The owner has full control over pool parameters i.e. accepted crypto tokens and fee traders have to pay to access liquidity in the pool.

- Shared Pools: Shared Pools where the pool’s tokens, weights, and fees are permanently set. Pool creator has no special privileges. Anyone may add liquidity to shared pools and ownership of the pool’s liquidity is tracked with a specific token called BPT - Balancer Pool Token. This is similar to how liquidity pools work on Uniswap.

- Smart Pools: Like Shared Pools, ownership is tracked by BPTs. These pools can also accept liquidity from anyone and at the same time can have arbitrary restrictions on how pool parameters can be changed.
