# Balancer in Simple Terms

[Balancer](https://balancer.exchange/) is a relatively new decentralized exchange that was launched in March 2020.

From trader's perspective it's another decentralized platform to exchange Ethereum and ERC20 tokens in a decentralized manner.

Balancer provides more flexible opportunities for liquidity providers on the platform by introducing different types of liquidity pools. 

## Trading on Balancer

- Trading fees on Balancer will vary from one pool to another. Depending on the tokens and liquidity pool involved in the trade there will be a different fee.

- As the case with Uniswap, the bigger your swap amount, the higher is the slippage in the price. In other words, more tokens user tries to buy/sell (in relation to the size of the pool) the less favorable will be the price. 

## Liquidity Pools

Just like Uniswap and Curve, Balancer enables users to earn fees on their Ethereum-based idle assets. 

However, liquidity pools provided by Balancer are more flexible:

- A user can provide liquidity by either creating a liquidity pool or adding their assets to existing pools.

- Balancer pools can have 2-8 assets in its liquidity pool. 

- Unlike Uniswap which requires all pool assets for deposit, on Balancer providers are able to provide liquidity in any asset supported by the pool.





- Liquidity pool assets can be configured to maintain a certain ratio in relation to total value in the pool. The pool can auto-balance and always maintain the required ratio.

- Self balancing liquidity pools allow cryptocurrency investors to group cryptocurrency assets meant for long term investments into a auto-balancing index fund for easier tracking.

- Users can deposit their entire portfolios into Balancer’s automated rebalancing liquidity pools & earn fees as other users trade against their portfolio.

- Anyone can now create their own self-balancing index fund or invest in someone else’s.

- One of the key uniques selling points of Balancer lies in ability to set up personal index fund without undertaking complex re-balancing actions.

- Balancer is permissionless in that the pools cannot be censored nor can the smart contracts be edited or shut down once they’ve been activated. 

- liquidity providers receive LP tokens which are needed to withdraw liquidity from the pool in the future.

- all Balancer pools are themselves represented by ERC-20 tokens, allowing the composability feature of creating Balancer pools of Balancer pools.




Balancer allows is able to provide slightly lower trading fees for various pairs due to some incentives for liquidity providers to keep the fees low.


- Balancer recently introduced its native governance tokens called BAL which is distributed to liquidity providers.

- The lower the pool fees, the more BAL the pool receives. The higher the trading fees, the less BAL the pool receives. Ultimately, this creates a rather elegant design as pool creators (as well as liquidity providers) will have to factor in whether they’d prefer to play the short-game and potentially earn higher trading fees or play the long-game by minimizing trading fees to maximize their BAL earnings.


- Balancer will filter through applicable pools containing your requested tokens and spread your order using the most efficient allocation to provide the best possible price.



## Pool Types

1. Shared Pools

    Shared Pools where the pool’s tokens, weights, and fees are permanently set on creation without means to change them. 
    
    Pool creator has no special privileges. Anyone may add liquidity to shared pools and ownership of the pool’s liquidity is tracked with a specific token called BPT - Balancer Pool Token.

2. Private Pools

    The creator of the pool has full permissions and only he/she has full control over pool parameters i.e. accepted tokens, token weights, fee traders have to pay to access liquidity, etc.
    
    However, the only address that can provide liquidity to it is the pool creator. This is useful for index funds that manage funds of third parties for example.
     
3. Smart Pools     
     
    Smart pools are a type of private pools that are owned by a smart contract, rather than a person who created the pool. 
  
    Like Shared Pools, ownership is tracked by BPTs. These pools can also accept liquidity from anyone and at the same time can have arbitrary restrictions on how pool parameters can be changed.

## Balancer Token

> Although we are taking every precaution and doing extensive audits, this is still very much a beta product. Use small amounts of funds to start.





The mathematical properties of Balancer protocol ensure that the value percentage of each token in a pool will stick closely to the weight even as the market prices of the tokens themselves vary. 

A Balancer Pool is a self-balancing index fund

This means that each Balancer pool is a self-balancing index fund itself. But it gets better. In a conventional index fund the investor has to pay a fee for the rebalancing service, but in a Balancer pool the liquidity provider is actually rewarded for their service of providing liquidity to the protocol. They earn fees while their index funds are continuously rebalanced for them.
