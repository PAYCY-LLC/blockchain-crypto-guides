# MakerDAO & DAI in Simple Terms

Let’s start with a brief introduction to Decentralized Finance or DeFi as everyone calls it these days.

Bitcoin was the first blockchain which paved the way for decentralized finance that allowed anyone to receive, send and hold Bitcoin without third party service providers such as banks. 

In its current state the Bitcoin blockchain is limited to plain transfers of Bitcoins from one address to another.

> The Ethereum blockchain goes far beyond simple transfers and is not limited in complexity of logic that can be coded into a transaction. 
>
> Programmers can build any type of public services with complex logic describing the nature of a business or financial contract and let it operate autonomously without means for someone to interfere. 
>
> For as long as the Ethereum blockchain is online, these service remain operational and work exactly as intended.

Ethereum expanded the idea of blockchain from tracking payments between addresses to all kinds of conditional contracts. As a result the concept of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) was born.

When people say DeFi they usually refer to financial services built on top of Ethereum or one of its smaller alternatives like the EOSIO blockchain platform. 

That said, most of the high net worth projects serving the public in the DeFI ecosystem are working on top of the Ethereum blockchain. 

If you would like to learn more about Ethereum and existing DeFi projects built on top of it, read our Ethereum guide.

## MakerDAO Overview

MakerDAO is one of the very first DeFI projects built on top of Ethereum blockchain. 

The project currently controls worth over half a billion USD, all in an automated manner by a predefined set of rules (aka Smart Contracts) known as Maker Protocol.

> Smart Contract is a computer program that leaves on a blockchain and transparent in the way it operates. Usually coded in a way s0 it's impossible to change it.
>
> Anyone with programming skills can locate the smart contract on the blockchain and verify that it works exactly as expected and is without loopholes. 

MakerDAO was the first DeFi project to earn global adoption and remains a leader in the amount of funds it controls. 

It is governed by a geographically distributed set of entities ranging from organizations to private individuals.

The project was launched in 2014 and comes in a form of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

### DAO Explained

If you’re not familiar with the concept of DAO, then simply think of it as a project or organization which meets following criteria: 

- controlled by a distributed group of entities
- usually has no official address, office etc
- governance of the DAO is exercised through ownership of some token
- any public entity can verify that organization operates as described
- the code operates on an open public blockchain

In a way, DAO is an alternative to a traditional corporation where ownership structure is defined by the number of shares someone owns. 

> Unlike traditional corporations, DAO exists on a blockchain and operates according to pre-coded rules, without any means for someone to step in and change the rules of engagement. 

If that concept looks somewhat blurry to you then no worries it’s a difficult concept to grasp for someone not familiar with the mechanics of blockchain tech. 

At this point you can just take it for granted that such systems have been around for a few years and MakerDAO is one of such systems.

MakerDAO is a DAO that operates a lending facility built on the Ethereum. The governance of the MakerDAO is executed through voting by those in possession of MKR tokens. 

As will be illustrated later, the incentive for someone to be a part of MakerDAO comes from various public-facing services provided by MakerDAO.

### DAI Stablecoin As A Service

MakerDAO consists of a set of public smart contracts known as Maker Protocol which autonomously handle the lending process.

The DAI token is the core product of MakerDAO. The DAI is the currency of every single loan Maker Protocol issues to the public. The DAI token itself is a stablecoin. When people take out loans they have to pay service fees which benefit MakerDAO. 

Most of the services provided by MakerDAO are built around DAI stablecoin.

> The term stablecoin refers to a cryptocurrency which attempts to peg its market value to some external reference, usually it’s USD, EUR or Gold.

The Maker Protocol enables users to lock their Ether tokens as collateral and in return obtain DAI tokens. The collateral release on repayment of the loan.

1. Every time the loan is issued by MakerDAO’s Maker Protocol to someone a new DAI enters circulating supply. At the same time a new collateral in Ether (equivalent to 150% of the DAI value) deposited to the Maker Protocol reserves. 
2. When the loan is returned, the collateral is released back to the user, and the returned DAI is destroyed by Maker Protocol. A service fee is paid by the borrower.

Maker Protocol is what controls the circulating supply of DAI. The Maker Protocol also ensures that the price of DAI remains very close to or equal to 1 USD at all times. As will be shown later on the protocol has many tools at its disposal for balancing the price of DAI.
 
DAI is trustless because anyone can verify that stablecoin is indeed backed by an amount of collateral to account for the circulating supply. That collateral can be used to buy out every single DAI out in circulation without the need to trust someone. Unlike DAI, most stablecoins are centralized and require a high level of trust from a person holding the coins.

### MakerDAO Governance

Being a DAO the MakerDAO project is entirely governed by anyone in possession of an MKR token. The ownership of MKR token is directly proportional to the ownership and vote weight on any decisions in the MakerDAO. There are slightly over a million of MKR tokens in circulation.

Ongoing governance of the MakerDAO works through formal proposals which can be voted on and approved by MKR token holders.

- When the proposal meets a certain threshold the underlying code powering the MakerDAO ecosystem gets updated to implement the proposed changes. 
- There is no way to bypass this process to implement changes in the Maker Protocol. 

The active proposals can be monitored here, https://vote.makerdao.com

MKR token holders govern the MakerDAO and the Maker Protocol via voting. The token holders benefit when someone uses one of the services offered by MakerDAO i.e. taking a loan. 

Primary MakerDAO services for the public require MKR tokens as payment. As more people use MakerDAO services the demand for MKR goes up which inturn increases the value for those already in possession of MKR tokens due to the increased demand. So, MKR token holders financially benefit from the growth of the network. 

The token holders also collectively share the financial risks of DAI stablecoin to ensure its stability, transparency, and efficiency. 

Any stability issues with DAI will have a direct impact on the price of MKR token, as the latter will have to be minted (increasing the total supply of MKR tokens in circulation) and sold to cover the losses of the Maker Protocol.

At the moment, there are slightly over 1 million MKR tokens in circulation. MKR tokens can be bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges just like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The price of the MKR token is determined by the open market forces.

Just like the DAI, the MKR token is an Ethereum based token and can be stored in pretty much any non-custodial crypto wallet like Unstoppable, https://unstoppable.money











## MakerDAO Services

MakerDAO provides the following services to the general public.
Oasis - Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange
Ability to take a loan in DAI from Maker Protocol
Ability to deposit / lend DAI to Maker Protocol and earn interest rate

Oasis Decentralized Marketplace

The Oasis is a service that provides access to a decentralized token exchange service on the Ethereum blockchain. The Oasis platform enables users to trade Ethereum and a number of other Ethereum based assets in a peer to peer manner, without the risk of being frauded. The  platform is free to use except for the actual blockchain fees originating from swapping tokens. 

Oasis also provides means to access core MakerDAO services such as borrowing and lending DAI tokens. While the Oasis platform is accessible through a website https://oasis.app, the services it provides can be also accessed by communicating with the Ethereum blockchain directly.


The Oasis website is just one of the many ways to interact with the Maker Protocol. Those familiar with programming on Ethereum can access MakerDAO services by interacting with Maker Protocol smart contracts using various means and not use the website at all.

To use the Oasis website users need one of the supported Ethereum wallets which will be used to deposit and withdraw funds to/from Oasis exchange. The easiest option is to install Chrome browser and use the Metamask browser plugin https://metamask.io. 

Metamask is an Ethereum wallet that works on top of the Chrome browser. Metamask wallet is non-custodial meaning that only the user has full control over the funds. 

Here is a good guide on using Metamask, https://tokenmarket.net/what-is/how-to-install-and-setup-metamask/


Keep in mind when you interact with decentralized platforms like Oasis token exchange, MakerDAO services or instruments like Metamask there are no means to roll back anything should you make a mistake with funds somewhere like say sending transaction to a wrong address.


Borrowing DAI from Maker Protocol

One of the core services provided by MakerDAO is the ability to borrow DAI tokens from the Maker Protocol in exchange for locking Ether tokens as collateral.

The steps are fairly straightforward, the user sends Ether as collateral to a smart contract known as Maker Vault. That smart contract locks in the received Ether and in exchange allows the user to generate a certain amount of DAI tokens, depending on the current market price of the Ether.


The Maker Vault is a core component of the Maker Protocol, which facilitates the generation of DAI against locked up collateral. All DAI in circulation are created by Maker Vaults and more importantly have underlying assets backing each DAI.


Users interact with Maker Vaults and the Maker Protocol directly, and each user has complete and independent control over their deposited collateral as long the value of that collateral doesn’t fall below the required minimum level. 

The mechanism by which Maker Vaults operate offer fairly flexible terms. There are no repayment schedules and no credit history requirements. Users can repay at their own pace as long as their Vault is properly collateralized. 

Each user borrowing DAI generates a unique Maker Vault as a result of that action. That Vault is unique to the user usually varies from other Vaults in the ecosystem in the following ways:


Collateral Currency : The Maker Vaults currently accept Ether (Ethereum’s native token) or a BAT (Basic Attention Token) token. There may be other tokens in the future if MakerDAO votes on it.

Collateralization Ratio : Maker Vaults require a collateral 150% worth of the requested DAI amount. In other words, to borrow 100 DAI you will need to lock 150$ worth of Ether tokens as collateral. The collateralization ratio of 150% is a value set by MakerDAO and may change in the future. As the price of the Ether fluctuates the collateralization ratio for each vault changes along with it.

Vault Health : When the price of Ether increases so is the collateralization ratio of each vault, allowing users to generate even more DAI from that vault without the need to add any more collateral. The reverse is true as well, if the price of Ether goes down significantly the vault can become under collateralized and be at risk of liquidating. The vault is considered healthy when it’s collateralization ratio is above 150%. It’s a responsibility of the user to continuously monitor the vault and ensure it remains healthy. When the collateralization ratio of the Vault nears 150$ the user may either deposit more collateral into it or return a portion of the borrowed DAI. Both of the options would increase the collateralization ratio of the Vault.

Liquidation Price : Liquidation is the process that is automatically initiated by the Maker Protocol when the collateralization ratio of the vault falls below 150%. During the liquidation process the collateral that is locked in the vault is automatically auctioned on the market with an aim to buy on the market the amount of DAI the Vault has issued to the user. During the Liquidation process, enough collateral is sold to cover the debt along with a Liquidation Penalty (that is 13% of collateral). Whatever remains will be available for withdrawal to the user.

Stability Fee : To reclaim the collateral in the Vault, users must repay the borrowed amount of DAI and the accumulated stability fees. The Stability Fee is a fee paid by every Vault owner. At this point in time, it is an annual percentage yield (0.5%) that is calculated on top of the existing Vault debt. Stability Fees must be paid in DAI or MKR token. As will be explained below, Stability Fee is one of the mechanisms of MakerDAO to control the price of DAI and help it maintain the dollar peg. The stability fee amount can change as a result of voting by MKR token holders.

Lending DAI to Maker Protocol
In November 2019 the MakerDAO project received a major upgrade. The upgrade introduced the capability for users to deposit their DAI holdings to Maker Protocol and earn an interest rate known as DAI Savings Rate (DSR). 

The steps are really simple, the user sends DAI tokens to a smart contract which keeps the funds locked and tracks the accrued interest rate. Think of this service as a regular savings account that pays an interest on your savings. 
There are no withdrawal limits, deposit limits, or liquidity constraints. The table below shows how the DSR rates have changed over time:


DATE
RATE
November 18th 2019
2.00 %
December 6th 2019
4.00 %
January 8th 2020
6.00 %
January 26th 2020
7.75 %
February 4th 2020
8.75 %
February 9th 2020
7.5 %
February 20th 2020
8.00 %
March 15th 2020
4.00 %
March 17th 2020
0 % *

* On March 17’th, MakerDAO dropped the DSR to 0% with an aim to bring the value of DAI closer to 1$.


The Maker Protocol pays depositors an interest rate from the funds it accumulates from Stability Fees collected from Vaults. Since the Maker Protocol pays the DSR from funds earned through Stability Fee – the DSR can never exceed the Stability Fee. If the current Stability Fee is 0.5% then the DSR can not exceed that amount unless the MakerDAO votes on increasing the Stability Fee.

Just like the Stability Fee rate, the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) amount is decided by MakerDAO vote. In combination with Stability Fee, the Dai Savings Rate, provides MakerDAO with the practical means to control the supply/demand aspects of the DAI stablecoin and ensure that the price of the DAI remains very close to 1$. 
Stability Fee is one of the mechanisms of MakerDAO to control the price of DAI and help it maintain dollar peg. The stability fee amount can change as a result of voting by MKR token holders.


4. DAI and MKR Economics

The automated mechanics put in place by MakerDAO has been able to consistently sustain the price of the DAI token in the range of 1$ over the last couple of years. The mechanics of this process will be explained below

At the same time the price of MKR token continued to appreciate in value making significant returns over the long term. 

DAI Stability Mechanics

With borrowing / lending mechanisms in place DAI can be considered a fairly robust stablecoin. Merchants worldwide both online and offline can potentially consider accepting it as a means of payment. The merchants can sell merchandise for DAI and then deposit received DAI to Maker Protocol and earn an interest rate. 

// DAI price image



Let’s see how this works in practice by illustrating how the MakerDAO can control supply/demand mechanisms for the DAI token and by doing so control it’s price:

Let’s assume the DAI price on the market fell to 0.99$ and the MakerDAO needs to bring it back to 1$. To do so the MakerDAO may increase the demand (or reduce supply) for DAI tokens. 
The increase in DSR is likely to increase the demand for DAI tokens as more people are encouraged to deposit DAI holdings into Maker Protocol and earn interest. At the same time, the increase in Stability Fees can make it more expensive to create new DAI and reduce the circulating supply. This in turn should push the market price of DAI higher.
Now, let’s say that at some point the price of DAI went to 1.01$. At this point the MakerDAO needs to reduce the price, bringing it closer to 1$. To do so MakerDAO may reduce the demand (or increase the supply) for DAI tokens.
The decrease in DSR is likely to reduce the demand for DAI tokens as less people would want to deposit DAI holdings and earn interest. At the same time, the Stability Fees can be brought down further and make it cheaper to create new DAI and increase the circulating supply. This in turn should push the market price of DAI lower.


Another aspect here is that what happens when the price of the collateral assets (currently that is Ether) falls sharply: 



The fact that there is a 150% collateral in the Maker Vaults ensures that there is some significant cushion for the Maker Vault giving Maker Protocol enough time to liquidate the collateral and recover the lent DAI.

However, should the price drop be significant enough to cause a shortfall in collateral relative to the amount of Dai borrowed against it, the MKR supply is diluted and sold onto the open market to purchase DAI and offset this imbalance. 

This encourages the MKR holders to govern the system well and charge an appropriate Stability Fees for the loans they are insuring. If the Maker governors issue bad debt, it is the Maker governors who pay. Yes, if all value in the MKR token is also wiped out, then Dai holders would ultimately suffer, but there is no situation where MKR holders are bailed out at the expense of DAI holders.


The recent issue in the MakerDAO is an ideal example to illustrate this in action. There used to be exactly 1,000,000 tokens right until March 2020. In mid March 2020 there was an incident as a result of which MakerDAO ended up with about 4.5 million worth of bad debt. 

Due to a series of unforeseen events the Maker Protocol failed to liquidate the collaterals held in some of the Maker Vaults when the collateralization ratio in these vaults fell below 150%. This happened on the day when Ethereum price dropped nearly 50% in a single day, the biggest daily drop in its history.

The drop caused massive activity on the Ethereum blockchain as a result of which the Liquidation process did not execute as it was supposed to. Long story short, about 4.5 million worth of DAI that should have been destroyed (disappear from circulation) by Maker Protocol didn’t get destroyed. To account for that MakerDAO initiated a so called Debt Auction where new MKR tokens were issued/printed and sold for DAI to the bidders and then destroyed by the Maker Protocol.

The Maker (MKR) Value

As was shown earlier, the MKR token holders govern the MakerDAO and the Maker Protocol via voting. The holders also have control over the smart contract that governs the operational procedures of the token.

The value of the MKR token comes from the ability to control the MakerDAO protocol and its various aspects which in turn have a direct impact on the number of DAI tokens in circulation.

// image of the MKR price since inception

When the MakerDAO is governed well the amount of MKR in circulation can be potentially decreased and push the value of the remaining MKR tokens higher. In the same way, poor governance may result in the dilution of the token value. This is primarily due to the fact that MKR token holders will ultimately have to cover the losses of the Maker Protocol (if there are any).


As more people start to use MakerDAO services the demand for the MKR tokens should keep rising as the fees collected in those services can potentially be used to buy the MKR tokens from the market and burn/destroy them, thereby reducing MKT token supply.


5. Conclusion

To this day, MakerDAO is widely considered as one of the most successful Decentralized Finance projects as well as one of the very first projects that operate under the DAO model. For many the project has proved that DAO model is a viable one. The beauty of such a model that it doesn’t discriminate and allows pretty much anyone to take part in the governance of the project. Those who invested in MakerDAO in early stages saw significant return on their investments

It’s yet to be seen whether the project will be able to handle unforeseen events in the future and survive. There are many uncertainties which may result in significant risks for the project ranging from the undiscovered software bugs in the code powering MakerDAO’s smart contract to the potential issues in the Ethereum blockchain itself.





## Maker Foundation

It should be noted that at the moment there is a key entity in the MakerDAO community known as Maker Foundation. The Maker Foundation built and launched the Maker Protocol in conjunction with a number of outside partners.

While the governance elements of the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol are exercised through token ownership and voting mechanisms there are some other organizational aspects to the MakerDAO which are currently overseen by Maker Foundation. 

Some of such organizational aspects are the weekly Governance and Risk meetings where the MKR holders talk about the key issues for the present day. The link below shows the schedule and agenda for the past and upcoming meetings.

https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles

Most of the past meetings are also available on Youtube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOm5yhqY38

It should further be noted that Maker Foundation is currently working with the MakerDAO community to further decentralize the governance of the project. 

The aim is to achieve complete decentralization in the near term where all organizational aspects are overseen by the community rather than the Maker Foundation.

Until recently the Maker Foundation had an exclusive control over the smart contract that controlled the mechanics of the MKR token. While any changes to the mechanics of that smart contract can not go unnoticed, the Maker Foundation was uniquely privileged in their ability to control it. 

In March 2020, the control of that contract was changed and passed fully to the MakerDAO community. Read more about it below and in fact there are means to verify that this change actually took place by exploring the relevant transaction on Ethereum blockchain itself.

DAI Foundation

The Dai Foundation is an entity based in Denmark and independent of the Maker Foundation. It was formed to oversee and legally control the MakerDAO's key intangible assets, such as trademarks and code copyrights. 

It operates solely on the basis of objective and rigid statutes that define its mandate. Its purpose, as noted in the Dai Foundation Trust Deed, is to safeguard what cannot be technologically decentralized in the Maker Protocol.
