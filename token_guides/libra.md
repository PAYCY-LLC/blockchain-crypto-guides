# Ethereum in Simple Terms

Ethereum is regularly mentioned alongside Bitcoin as one of the most popular decentralized cryptocurrencies. But what is Ethereum? What makes it different from Bitcoin and why there is so much hype around it?

Ethereum was first proposed in 2013 but came to prominence in 2015, some six years after Bitcoin. The Ethereum platform and ecosystem was initially proposed and developed by Vitalik Buterin, along with several other contributors and co-founders. 

At this point in time, Ethereum is likely to be one of the biggest open blockchains in the world with over a million independent software developers working independently in improving various aspects of the blockchain on a daily basis.

Ethereum proposed a different approach to cryptocurrency and blockchain, in comparison to existing projects. 

Where Bitcoin is a store of value and limited to transfers of Bitcoin from one address to another, Ethereum is the foundation for building decentralized services. 

It can be thought of as an open platform where anyone can deploy any type of service that operates in a transparent manner without means to cheat. If Bitcoin is a specialized hammer, Ethereum is an entire tool set.

## Why Ethereum

Any software engineer can use the Ethereum platform and build the decentralized application they want. 

The Ethereum platform is open to all and anyone without the need for someone’s permission can use it and provide services on top of it. For as long as Ethereum is running and there is at least one network server (also known as node) the services built on Ethereum will remain operational and accessible to the public.

The terms Ethereum network, Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum platform usually mean the same thing. 

The Ethereum network consists of all servers worldwide operating the Ethereum node software. Note that anyone in the world can operate an Ethereum node without much effort. 

> The purpose of Bitcoin is to provide a reliable store of value, and a medium for exchange as an alternative to digital payments.
>
> The idea behind Ethereum is to enable anyone to create decentralized applications and services that operate on an open publicly-accessible platform.

The Ethereum platform guarantees that service operates transparently, and without means to cheat the system. 

For example, a poker game, or a lottery application built on Ethereum cannot cheat. It’s transparent in the way it operates and works exactly the way it was programmed. Anyone with sufficient technical knowledge can check the code powering application on Ethereum and confirm there are no workarounds, or vulnerabilities. 

Conversely, with a regular poker app or website, there is no way of checking the code. You have to place your trust in the developer of the service. 

## Ethereum Blockchain

Ethereum is first and foremost a blockchain. The blockchain is essentially a digital 'history of records' that tracks every action (usually called transaction) made on Ethereum. 

As users worldwide perform various actions on Ethereum, a new block holding all those transactions is generated every 10 to 15 seconds and added to the Ethereum blockchain. The term 'added to the Ethereum blockchain' basically means that every single Ethereum node (server) adds this block as the last block to its local copy of the history of blocks. 

Each of those nodes holds a live copy of the Ethereum blockchain: an entire history of transactions since the very beginning.

## Ethereum Nodes

Ethereum network nodes earn Ether, which is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. Rather than calling it Ether a lot of people call this cryptocurrency Ethereum :) 

Whenever a node completes a piece of work, like processing or validating a transaction, it earns a little of Ether. 

> Ether is like a fuel for completing transactions on the Ethereum network. The Ethereum nodes are vital for the proper operation of the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone can unconditionally operate an Ethereum node and potentially earn some Ether as a reward for contributing to the network powering the system. 

A transaction on the Ethereum blockchain ranges from a simple transfer of Ether tokens from one wallet address to another, to more complex processes such as the execution of a decentralized program (aka, smart contract---more on these in a moment!).

The more nodes there are online the more secure Ethereum blockchain is. A node cannot cheat the rest of the network. 

Every node individually validates every transaction, ensuring only legitimate transactions enter the blockchain. 

## Ether Currency

Tha native unit of measurement on Ethereum blockchain is called Ether. In other words,  Ether is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.

The number of Ethers in the Ethereum network is not fixed and steadily increases. The emission of Ether is built into Ethereum protocol and is there to encourage people to run Ethereum nodes (which in turn keeps the network healthy and importantly, decentralized). 

> There are several core differences between the operation of Ethereum and Bitcoin regarding the creation and distribution. For example, once the total number of Bitcoins reaches 21 million, no more Bitcoin will be created. Whereas, there is no such upper limit to the total Ethereum supply.

The supply of new Ether is limited to 18 million tokens per year, although that limit has never been reached. The supply of new Ether has averaged just under 9 million per year since 2015.

## Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a program (piece of code) that works with a blockchain to enforce the terms of a contractual agreement. The major difference between a regular physical paper contract and a smart contract is enforcement. Where a regular contract outlines the terms of the agreement, a smart contract takes that one step further and enforces the terms of the agreement automatically on the blockchain, once the smart contract criteria are met.

In the simplest of terms, a smart contract is an example of a "when X takes place, do Y" scenario. When a contract like this put on Ethereum blockchain, there is generally no means to change the terms of the contract after it is published. When the conditions become valid all network nodes on the Ethereum blockchain process it and enforce the terms outlined in the smart contract.

The development and use of smart contracts are one of the fundamental properties that differentiate Ethereum from other blockchains. 

> Smart Contracts makes it possible to build all kinds of services on Ethereum that can go far beyond the mere transfer of currency tokens from one address to another.

Smart contracts allow for the development of programs with extensive functionality, such as to hold, accept, or send Ether under certain circumstances, or to interact with different services, and so on. This is distinct from say a Bitcoin where the only action is to send tokens from one crypto wallet to another.

For example, someone can develop a smart contract that holds a balance of X Ether, that is programmed to pay out its entire balance when someone provides the correct solution to a math problem outlined in the smart contract. 

If a user submits the incorrect answer, the smart contract requirements remain unfulfilled and will not trigger. When a user submits the correct answer, the smart contract executes its code and pays out the full balance to the user's Ethereum wallet address. The contract may also for instance require that all participants pay an entry fee to participate in the challenge.

Anyone with sufficient knowledge can write up a smart contract and add it to Ethereum blockchain. Once written and signed off by the vested parties, the smart contract is broadcast to the Ethereum network and stored there permanently.

Smart contracts are public and visible to all. Anyone can lookup the address of the contract on the Ethereum and use one of the publicly available tools to decode the contract terms and see what it can and can't do. 

## Decentralized Applications

Decentralized Applications (DApps) are built with the help of smart contracts. Smart contracts hold the rules according to which the DApp operates. 

A single DApp may consist of one or more interconnected smart contracts.

Although it may sound complicated, there is a very easy way to consider how DApps operate. 

A regular website or app is centralized, using a centralized server where a single entity or organization controls everything to do with the service. The website or app could disappear at any time without warning, or the service users could experience censorship, outages and sudden changes. Whereas, a decentralized app uses a distributed structure to protect against those issues. 

Furthermore, the DApps operation and functionality are written once during development. Once the DApp distributes amongst users, and the service goes live, no single entity can make sweeping changes to the system, and no single entity can censor someone from interacting with DApp. Unless the creator of the DApps deliberately adds means to do so. When such means are in place people can easily spot them as well.

## Tokens

Thousands of DApps use the Ethereum blockchain. Usually, DApps have some kind of token (unit of something) coded into its smart contract. The tokens are used as a means of measuring the value of something in the service DApp aims to provide. 

If a smart contract is built of an organization management a token can be used to identify the voting power or even a revenue share of individuals in that organization. 

When a DApp becomes popular the tokens it operates usually become tradeable on public cryptocurrency exchanges just like stocks.

Below are some real-world Ethereum DApp examples:

### 1. MakerDAO 

MakerDAO (https://makerdao.com/en/) is a decentralized autonomous organization that operates a lending facility on Ethereum blockchain. MakerDAO is functioning autonomously, entirely on Ethereum blockchain, and governed by a distributed group fo entities. MakerDAO currently manages reserves exceeding half a billion USD in value. 

There are two Ethereum based tokens associated with MakerDAO smart contracts. These are MKR and DAI tokens.

* MKR tokens are used for the governance of the organization. MKR token holders are decision makers. 

* Also, in addition to MKR, there is a DAI token. DAI is the currency of the loans that MakerDAO gives. DAI is as a stablecoin because it's pegged 1:1 to the US dollar.

### 2. 0x Protocol

Similar to MakerDAO there are other organizations, launching all kinds of services on Ethereum blockchain where the service is powered by a custom token. 

Many of those tokens represent value and are traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. 0x protocol (https://0x.org) enables exchanging these tokens in a decentralized manner. Ox Protocol is like an autonomous broker that doesn’t depend on any entity to function. 

The ZRX is the native token for the 0x Protocol which is used as a means of exchanging tokens powered by different smart contracts. Moreover, holding ZRX token enables users to vote on improvements to 0x Protocol. In addition, users can stake ZRX to earn rewards.

### 3. Crypto Exchange Tokens

Several multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency exchanges provide a token that is managed by a smart contract on Ethereum. 

For the most part, these exchange tokens reduce transaction fees on the host exchange, offering users the chance to pay vastly reduced fees. The prominent examples of this are:
 
- Binance Coin
- Huobi Token

Both tokens are traded on several cryptocurrency exchanges and valued in billion USD ranges.

### 4. Basic Attention Token

Basic Attention Token (BAT) is the native token powering the Brave advertising platform. The BAT token is integrated into the privacy-focused Brave web browser which is currently used by over 8 million people per month.

### 5. Stablecoins

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency tokens that are pegged to fiat currencies like USD. STablecoin usually have a fixed value and can be exchanged to a currency it's pegged to at 1-1 rate.

- Tether (USDT), launched in October 2014, is a stablecoin that enables cryptocurrency users to swap their holdings into a dollar-equivalent stable currency at a 1:1 ratio. Tether is backed 1 to 1 by liquid USD reserves.

- USDC is a similar stablecoin, though a smaller one, which is run by a major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.


As you can see, a DApp can take many forms. The versatility of the Ethereum blockchain and size of its network, attracts engineers worldwide.

Most of the DApps built on Ethereum blockchain are financial services that use Ether or native DApp tokens. Currently, smart contracts powering these financial services cumulatively handle over 1 billion USD in value .

## Interacting With DApps

...

## Ethereum Transactions

Theoretically, Ethereum transactions are fast, especially in comparison with Bitcoin. A new Ethereum block releases roughly every 15 seconds. Ethereum nodes process transactions as rapidly as they arrive, and cumulatively the network can process over 1 million transactions in a single day under the right circumstances.
The actual answer lies in the Ethereum network processing power at any one time. When the Ethereum network is under considerable demand, a single transaction can take hours to complete. The result is a serious backlog of payment transactions and some DApps cannot function correctly because they cannot interact properly with the Ethereum blockchain.
Your Ethereum transaction time, then, can vary. The processing time centers around the concept of gas, the transaction fee each Ethereum transaction carries. Certain Ethereum wallets allow you to modify the amount of gas you are willing to pay for your transaction. As you would expect, more gas means a faster transaction. Some of the better wallets out there would recommend the optimal gas amount taking into account current state of activity on the network.

Ethereum network transactions experience the same limitations as the Bitcoin network, at least at the current time. A lot of open source blockchain engineers worldwide trying to address this issue in various ways.

## Privacy On Ethereum

In the case of Bitcoin blockchain the address for receiving payments can change (but don’t have to) with each transaction. Keeping privacy in mind, most Bitcoin wallets generate a new address after each incoming payment making it considerably more difficult to connect two different transactions to a single party.

When it comes to Ethereum blockchain your address to receive Ether payments will always be the same. Nearly all Ethereum wallets work this way nowadays. This is likely to change in the future but for the time being that’s how most Ethereum wallets work. The wallets generate and use a single Ethereum address. There are other technical reasons for that.
The balance and transactions originating to/from specific payment addresses are stored in a visible manner on Ethereum blockchain.

The key takeaway point here is that Ethereum blockchain is fully transparent allowing anyone to see all incoming/outgoing transactions for the given payment address. On the other hand, when it comes to Bitcoin blockchain the relationship between transactions breaks when a user uses a new payment address for each incoming payment. 

As a result, in its current state, Bitcoin transactions in wallets provide users with more privacy than Ethereum transactions in that same wallet. 

The only thing that adds some minimal privacy element into the mix is the fact there is no way to check who that address belongs to. On the other hand, when you’re sending/receiving Ether, keep in mind that the other party can look up your balance as well as history of incoming/outgoing payments to/from that address.
With enough time and resources, someone could feasibly link certain transactions to individual users. If one of the cryptocurrency exchanges gets hacked and hackers get their hands on user data, this would potentially mean that someone can map Ethereum payment addresses to real world identities.
