# Bitcoin Cash In Simple Terms

Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that is a "fork" of a Bitcoin. It was created out of the Bitcoin blockchain in August, 2017.

While it shares the fundamentals with the Bitcoin (BTC) it's a different cryptocurrency.

In this guide we'll explain the process of how Bitcoin Cash came into existence, its relevance to Bitcoin(BTC) and some of its specifics.

> Bitcoin (BTC) and what's now known as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) used to be one cryptocurrency until August 2017.

Right now, despite having some similarities and 'bitcoin' in its names, they represent different cryptocurrencies and traded at different prices.
 
Each powered by its own blockchain network of servers, with its own user community and engineering resources.

## 1. Bitcoin Cash Origins

The Bitcoin cash emerged as a result of Bitcoin community's effort to address the blockchain speed issues.

As was previously mentioned, the Bitcoin blockchain is limited to a few million transactions per day.

> In its current state, the Bitcoin network can process about 10 transactions per second. On some busy days, it's not uncommon for Bitcoin transactions to remain in pending state for hours. 

Back in 2017, when trying to address this issue, prominent engineers and cryptocurrency miners have come up with two solutions to a problem.

The debate was primarily around changing the size of the blocks holding transactions in the blockchain. 

   - One group wanted to increase the block size limited from 1 MB to a higher value (specifically 8MB) and by doing so enable Bitcoin blockchain to process 8x more transactions per block. 

   - The other group was against increasing the block size limit and insisted on addressing the scalability issues via other means which are somewhat technical to describe here. 

A core group of conservatives wanted to keep blocks as is, so that Bitcoin network nodes could be operated with less resources. The more nodes there are the more decentralized and secure the Bitcoin blockchain is.

> The group in favor of increasing the block size felt the proposed solutions by the other camp are inadequate to address scaling issues and felt that increasing the block size is the way to go.

As a result of tha disagreement, the original Bitcoin community has split into two camps.

The split in community resulted in the split of the blockchain and the emergence of Bitcoin Cash blockchain and its native cryptocurrency BCH.

## 2. The Fork

As cryptocurrencies are open-source and no entity has exclusive rights ove the code powering them. 

Anyone can create a duplicate of the Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency via process known as "fork" and market it as something else.

The fork is a technical term used to describe the process of deriving one software product from another.

In cryptocurrency space where no one owns software, the forks occur when the community members are not able to agree on the way forward. In that regard, the fork provides a natural dispute resolution mechanism resulting in community splits. 

> While anyone can create a whatever cryptocurrency, it will not see the adoption among community unless there is a significant value proposition which can attract support of engineers, users and speculators.

In August 2017, the proponents of larger block sizes initiated what is known as a hard fork, effectively creating a new blockchain and cryptocurrency.

The group consisted of major Bitcoin miners, early-adopters, influencers and engineers.

> As mentioned before, the key element when it comes to understanding the value of one cryptocurrency is the size of its network. 

When the Bitcoin Cash was born, the original Bitcoin network lost a chunk of users which began to regard Bitcoin Cash as the 'true Bitcoin'.

Today, the ecosystem regards the original Bitcoin as the one with ticker BTC. It's the cryptocurrency people have in mind when talking about Bitcoin.

That said, the Bitcoin Cash managed to attract significant following, established itself as one of the major cryptocurrency projects and keeps growing on various fronts.

The Bitcoin Cash fork was not the only fork Bitcoin had but definitely the biggest one in terms of impact it had.

## 3. What Happened

On 1 August 2017 Bitcoin Cash began trading at about $240, while bitcoin traded at about $2,700.

At the time of the software upgrade anyone owning bitcoin came into possession of the same number of Bitcoin Cash units.

## 3. BCH vs BTC

Bitcoin Cash cryptocurrency, denoted by a symbol BCH, and id sometimes also referred to as BCash.

Being a spin-off from the classic Bitcoin blockchain it shares nearly all properties of Bitcoin:

- Circulation

- Ownership

When it comes to transacting in Bitcoin Cash, expect to notice some differences:

- Improved Confirmation Times 

    Bitcoin Cash transaction confirmation times are currently faster. BCH transactions reach finality faster making it more usable for everyday transactions.
    
    The difference is due to the fact that Bitcoin has a feature called RBF, which allows to sender to change the transaction while it remains in pending stage. Bitcoin Cash doesn't have that.

- Low Transaction Fees 

    Due to larger block limit and lower volume of transactions on the BCH blockchain, the transaction fess are much lower. It's not uncommon to pay fees as low as 1 cent.
    
    At the same time, transacting on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain can easily cost as much as 1-2$ per transaction.
    



- BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. 

Supply Scarcity â€“ During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.


## 4. BCH Blockchain

// while many look at it as an alternative it's complimentary

// smart contracts
// cheap
// demo some BCH apps
// can be a platform

## 5. BCH Network

In 2018 Bitcoin Core developer Cory Fields found a bug in the Bitcoin ABC software that would have allowed an attacker to create a block causing a chain split.
