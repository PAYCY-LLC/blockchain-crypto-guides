# Bitcoin Cash In Simple Terms

Bitcoin Cash, denoted by a symbol BCH, is a cryptocurrency that is a fork of a Bitcoin. Being a fork means that it was created from the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. 

Bitcoin Cash emerged out of the Bitcoin blockchain in August 2017. While it shares the fundamentals with the Bitcoin (BTC) it's a different cryptocurrency with its own blockchain.

In this guide we'll explain the process of how Bitcoin Cash (BCH) came into existence, its relevance to Bitcoin and how it's different from the original Bitcoin.

> Bitcoin (BTC) and what's now known as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) used to be one cryptocurrency until August 2017.

Right now, despite having some similarities and 'Bitcoin' in its names, both represent different cryptocurrencies and traded at different prices.

- [Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/)
 
Each powered by its own blockchain network of servers, has its own community, engineering resources and distinct vision for the future.

Below we'll look at how the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is different from Bitcoin (BTC). As both currencies share fundamentals, it's recommended for you to go over the Bitcoin guide first.

## 1. Bitcoin Cash Origins

As you may know from the Bitcoin guide the underlying blockchain powering Bitcoin is limited to a few million transactions per day. 

The Bitcoin Cash emerged as a result of the original Bitcoin community trying to find ways to increase the capacity of the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
> In its current state, the Bitcoin network can process about 10 transactions per second. On some busy days, it's not uncommon for Bitcoin transactions to remain in pending state for hours, sometimes even days. 
>
> For comparison, the Visa network does around 1,700 transactions per second on average and can scale up to [24,000 transactions](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html) per second.

Back in 2017, when trying to address this issue, the community couldn't reach consensus on the best way forward. 

The debate was primarily about the maximum size of the block in the blockchain. Because transactions are added to blockchain in blocks, the more transactions can fit in one block the more transactions can occur in a 10-minute period.

   - One group wanted to increase the Bitcoin blockchain block size limit from 1 MB to 8 MBs and subsequently even more. This would enable Bitcoin blockchain to instantly process up to 8x more transactions per block. 

   - The other group was against increasing the block size and insisted on addressing the scalability via other means. The group argued that increasing block size provides a temporary fix and won't solve the problem in the long run.

While this disagreement was at the center there were many other factors both technical and social which led to the split of opinion around the problem.

As a result, the original Bitcoin community which had been united since 2009 has split into two camps.

This subsequently resulted in the split of the network powering the Bitcoin blockchain and the emergence of Bitcoin Cash blockchain and its native cryptocurrency BCH.

## 2. Bitcoin Cash Fork

As cryptocurrencies are open-source and no entity has exclusive rights ove the code powering them, anyone can create a duplicate via a simple process known as ["fork"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) and market it as something else.

The fork is a technical term in software engineering used to describe the process of deriving one software product from another.

Forks may occur when the community members are not able to agree on the way forward. It provides a natural dispute resolution mechanism by allowing to split from the existing blockchain and continue with a distinct vision.

> While anyone can create a cryptocurrency, it will not see the adoption among community unless there is a significant value proposition which can attract support of engineers, users and speculators. 
>
> Without the community the cryptocurrency has no organic network that can guarantee its survival and growth.

In August 2017, the proponents of larger block size initiated a fork, effectively creating a new blockchain and cryptocurrency.

While that group didn't represent the majority, it had support of major Bitcoin miners, and a number of influential early-adopters, and engineers. 

In a way, the fork of Bitcoin Cash was a good demonstration of how the ideological conflicts may be resolved for open-source cryptocurrencies which are not owned by any entity.

Although, the Bitcoin Cash is not the only cryptocurrency that was forked from Bitcoin (there was [Litecoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin) as well), it's the most significant in terms of the impact it had on community.

Here are some key points you should understand regarding how Bitcoin Cash fork took place:

- both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash blockchains share identical history of transactions until the fork date.

- both blockchains have the same amount of cryptocurrency units, capped at 21 million.

- anyone who had Bitcoins in the non-custodial wallet at the time of fork also ended up with an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash units on the balance. 

After the fork took place, the Bitcoin Cash was born. The original Bitcoin network lost a chunk of its users which effectively migrated to the new Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

Over the last few years Bitcoin Cash has managed to attract significant following and became one of the few cryptocurrency projects that keeps evolving on various fronts.

That said, the original Bitcoin still has a much bigger network and more engineers working in the ecosystem. 

While the engineering efforts are hard to quantify there some network size attributes are available on the blockchain itself:

- There are on average 10-15 more entities interacting with Bitcoin then Bitcoin Cash. The page [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/activeaddresses-btc-bch.html) compares both blockchain by the number of addresses involved in transactions over the last 24 hour period.

- Another parameter to indicate the size of the network is so the [BTC vs BCH](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/difficulty-btc-bch.html) hashrate. Look at it as an indicator showing the number of entities running blockchain node. The more nodes there are the more secure and decentralized the network is.

## 3. Distinct Visions

Today, the community regards the original Bitcoin as the one with ticker BTC. It's the cryptocurrency people have in mind when talking about the Bitcoin.

> That said, there is an ongoing debate between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash communities as to which of the two cryptocurrencies is the 'true Bitcoin' that Satoshi Nakamoto intended to create.

Although both cryptocurrencies share origins the post-fork changes to blockchain code reflect a different vision for each project.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH):

Bitcoin Cash community views the BCH as a peer-to-peer digital cash which can be used to pay for anything, quickly and with close to zero transaction fees.

- As a result of block size changes, a single block on Bitcoin Cash can now hold up to 32x more transactions than Bitcoin can. The average transaction size for a Bitcoin Cash transaction is around 250 bytes. With 32MB blocks generated every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin Cash is theoretically capable of supporting 18,000,000 transactions per day.

- Despite the 32MB limit the blocks on Blockchain Cash blockchain [rarely](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-size.html) go over 1MB in size. In other words, there is not a lot of activity taking place. Bitcoin Cash blockchain processes less than [30,000 - 40,000](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-transactions.html) transactions per day.

- Transacting with Bitcoin Cash is very cheap at the moment and often in the range of 1 cent. Combine it with the fact that Bitcoin Cash payments reach finality faster (more on that below) you get both fast and cheap payments.

- Bitcoin Cash has a strong marketing community encouraging merchants to accept Bitcoin Cash for payments. However, we are yet to see any major global merchant accepting it as payment. 

Bitcoin (BTC):

Bitcoin is generally perceived as a store of value rather than digital cash. In that regard, more emphasis being put on security and privacy of the blockchain rather than the speed.

- While there is an ongoing work to improve the speed of Bitcoin transactions on various fronts, transacting with Bitcoin is still fairly expensive. On a busy day, it's not uncommon to pay a few dollars as transaction fees, regardless of the amount.

- Throughout 2020, there have been [on average](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html) 300K Bitcoin transactions per day. As can be seen [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/size-btc.html), the Bitcoin blockchain is close to reaching the capacity with the average block size being about 80-90% of capacity.

- The chart [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html) shows that the average transaction fee for Bitcoin was generally in the range of 1 USD throughout 2020. There was a brief period in May 2020 where the average fee was as high as 6$.

- Bitcoin community believes that scaling problem and fees will be resolved by independent complimentary projects like Lightning Network. While a lot of progress taking place on Lightning project it's still in early stages and needs more time before it can be properly tested. So, we are yet to see any global retailer accepting Bitcoin directly or via Lightning Network.

## 4. BCH Highlights

Many seem to look at Bitcoin Cash as an alternative to Bitcoin, giving an impression that's either one or the other.

However, taking into account different direction of the engineering efforts on both sides these projects are likely to coexist.

As a result of increased block size and post-fork blockchain code changes, the Bitcoin Cash blockchain got some significant differences.

- Instant Confirmation

    Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transactions reach finality faster making it more usable for everyday payments like paying for coffee, or a taxi ride. 
    
    The Bitcoin Cash transactions can generally be considered final as soon as they reach the network, few seconds after the transaction is sent. 
    
    When it comes to Bitcoin transaction, after the transaction reaches the network it also needs to be included in the blockchain before it can be considered final. That may easily take a few hours on a busy day, or even a few days. 
    
- Low Transaction Fees

    The transaction fees are relevant when a blockchain receives more transactions than it can fit in the block. In such cases, fees are used to prioritize transactions, giving priority to those that pay higher fees.

    Due to larger block size limit on Bitcoin Cash and generally lower volume of transactions on the BCH blockchain, the transaction fees are much lower there. Even when someone pays 1 cent per transaction there is always enough space to have it included in the block.
    
    That may change in the future if more people start transacting on Bitcoin Cash but now it's common to pay transaction fees as low as 1 cent. Sending a similar transaction on a Bitcoin blockchain can easily cost a couple of dollars or more.
    
    Note that if the Bitcoin blockchain suddenly becomes less busy than transaction fees will go down as well.
    
Apart from enabling cheaper and faster transactions on a blockchain, there are some other differences as well.
    
-  Decentralized Data Storage

    Due to low transaction fees and fast settlements the Bitcoin Cash blockchain can also be used as a decentralized, private and censorship-resistant data storage layer for decentralized applications.
    
    There are already third party applications utilizing the cheap storage aspect of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. [Memo.cash](https://memo.cash) is one such app.
    
    Practically speaking, using that feature of Bitcoin Cash blockchain someone can build a Twitter-like application where the user data stored on the blockchain and uncensorable.

- Smart Contracts

    The Bitcoin Cash blockchain is capable of having 'smart contract' like entities which can be pre-programmed to work autonomously, have its own balance and perform condition-based transactions.
    
    This capability is fairly new, and we are yet to see any Ethereum-style decentralized apps utilizing that aspect of Bitcoin Cash blockchain.   

Note that both Bitcoin and bitcoin Cash blockchains evolve very fast, and the highlights listed above may no longer be relevant in the next year or so.

Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash blockchains have a distributed engineering community constantly looking for ways to get rid of the current limitations. 

So, the highlights listed above may no longer be relevant in a year from now. Keep that in mind.

## 6. Bitcoin Cash Price

On 1 August 2017, shortly after the split, Bitcoin Cash emerged as a cryptocurrency coin and began trading at about $240, while the Bitcoin traded at about $2,700. 

Since then, [BCH price](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/) hasn't changed significantly while [BTC price](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) been ranging between $3,500 - $12,000.

In the long run, the price of the cryptocurrency likely to reflect the growth of its blockchain network and engineering/user community around the project.

Although Bitcoin Cash has one of the largest social communities around it's still significantly behind Ethereum and Bitcoin in that regard. In order for Bitcoin Cash to overtake the Bitcoin the demand for BCH coins should exceed the demand for BTC.
