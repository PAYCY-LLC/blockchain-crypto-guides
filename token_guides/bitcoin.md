# Bitcoin In Simple Terms

Crypto newcomers have a mountain of questions. 

- What is Bitcoin? 
- How does it work?
- What makes it special? 

The purpose of this guide is to answer those questions by introducing you to Bitcoin in simple terms and an easy-to-digest manner.

Over the last few years, Bitcoin network and its underlying cryptocurrency 'Bitcoin', has been labeled in many ways. It's been called everything from electronic cash to digital gold.

Increasingly people begin to perceive Bitcoin as wealth preservation instrument just like money, stocks or precious metals. The idea of having Bitcoin as another asset class doesn't seem too distant anymore.

Despite being around for 10 years, Bitcoin is still fairly complex and obscure to newcomers. Way until 2014 storing Bitcoin was not even a thing everyone could do. It has improved a lot since then but there are still complexities.

Most newcomers fail to grasp the value of the Bitcoin network on a first encounter. The Bitcoin often perceived purely as a cryptocurrency rather than a decentralized platform that can expand to host a large ecosystem of services.  

## 1. Bitcoin Origins

The idea of Bitcoin was first proposed by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) back in 2008. Satoshi created a blueprint outlining the mechanics of a network where the value exchanging transactions can happen without the middle man. 

> The ideas put forward in the paper required a good understanding of the contemporary monetary system and graduate-level knowledge of mathematics, cryptography, and computer science. 

In the paper, Satoshi proposed Bitcoin as a decentralized network which :

- not reliant upon any entity to function
- functional and accessible 24/7
- enforces equal rules for all participants
- available for anyone unconditionally
- censorship-resistant

That's how the Bitcoin blockchain was born. 

After Bitcoin made its debut the underlying blockchain technology spread to other projects resulting in other cryptocurrencies and decentralized systems.

Bitcoin was initially worthless; only a handful of people knew about it. In its early days, the public mostly perceived Bitcoin as fun money for geeks rather than as something that could challenge the financial system. 

The mainstream media played an influential role in shaping how the masses perceived Bitcoin in those first few years. 

Initially, nearly all media mentions of Bitcoin were negative. Indeed, the technology has been declared dead by various publications more than 400 times!

After a few years of growth via word-of-mouth marketing the Bitcoin turned into a massive phenomenon powered by a large network of users.

## 2. Bitcoin Cryptocurrency

As we have covered in our guide on blockchains, the cryptocurrency is a unit of measure on a blockchain. 

The Bitcoin cryptocurrency, denoted by a BTC symbol, is the native unit of measurement on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoins are limited and scarce. Eventually, there will be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. The steps below outline how the Bitcoins were created in entered circulation.

- Starting from early 2009, Bitcoin blockchain started functioning and every 10 minutes the program powering the blockchain been adding certain amount of Bitcoins to the network. So far, nearly 18.5 million Bitcoins have been released to the market this way.

- Roughly every 10 minutes, new Bitcoins are created and awarded to one of the nodes operating the Bitcoin network. 

- The award goes to a node that is first to solve a mathematical problem successfully. Although all nodes are trying to solve it, only the first one gets the pay-out. The process of solving the mathematical problem is what essentially called as mining.

- The Bitcoin network will create the remaining three million Bitcoins over the next 130 years in the manner described above.

- No single entity controls the release of new Bitcoins into circulation. It's an automated process that's regulated by algorithms. The algorithms were coded into Bitcoin at the start of its existence.

It's estimated that about four million Bitcoins have been already "lost." Typically, coins are lost because users have lost the wallets with Bitcoins on them without having a backup. 

Out of 18 million Bitcoins created so far, only about 14 million are actually available for transacting.

## 3. Bitcoin As A Network

Usually, the term Bitcoin used as a reference to cryptocurrency on the Bitcoin network.

> However, the Bitcoin is not just cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a network, and an open platform for commerce where the value denominated in Bitcoins.

Bitcoin network consists of different groups:
 
 - parties running Bitcoin node software
 - people accumulating Bitcoin in wallets
 - anyone who transacts in Bitcoin
 - engineers building services for Bitcoin

These are the people that drive the Bitcoin technology, adoption and demand for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

> The systematic increase in the bitcoin price was ultimately due to the growing number of people interested in Bitcoin.

Anyone can join the Bitcoin network and start using it on equal terms as everyone else. 

Most Bitcoin users typically participate in the role of a wallet. They send and receive payments.

Some users participate by running one of the Bitcoin nodes hosting a live copy of the Bitcoin blockchain. 

Bitcoin nodes process and validate transactions from wallets. Nodes also keep the full history of transactions since very beginning.

> The history of all Bitcoin transactions is also called the 'Bitcoin blockchain'.
>
> The Bitcoin blockchain is a chain of blocks where each block holds a batch of transactions. A new block added to Bitcoin blockchain roughly every 10 minutes.

Nodes ensure that only legitimate transactions are added to the blockchain. 

Cumulatively, Bitcoin nodes guarantee the openness, availability, decentralization, and security of the Bitcoin network. 

There are at [https://bitnodes.io](least 10,000 Bitcoin nodes) powering the Bitcoin network at any given time. All working for keeping Bitcoin network accessible and running 24/7.

Anyone can set up a node without much effort. The node doesn't require any maintenance and can even operate on an old computer.

- As long as at least one node is online, the Bitcoin network will remain accessible for transactions.
    
- The more nodes there are on the network, the harder it is for an entity to cheat. The other nodes would all work against it.
    
While all nodes on Bitcoin network are equal, some nodes may do more things than others. 

There are two main types:

- Full Nodes

    Full nodes keep a complete copy of the blockchain. Any full node can independently verify any transaction for validity.

- Miner Nodes

    All miner nodes continuously compete with each other to be the node that gets to add the next block to the blockchain. The miner node that is the first to solve a mathematical problem is the one that wins the associated Bitcoin reward. That's exactly how new Bitcoins added to circulation.

If you want to run a miner node for the sake of making some money, you need to consider the cost-efficiency of doing so. 

After taking electricity prices into account, you're very likely to lose money. Mining is generally only profitable for people running specialized computers and who are buying electricity at industrial rates in countries like China.

## 4. Bitcoin Price

Back in the first few years, the idea that Bitcoin would someday be worth thousands of dollars appeared outlandish. One early adopter famously spent 10,000 BTC (around $100,000,000 USD at current prices) on a single pizza.

> Fast-forward to June 2020, and Bitcoin is consistently trading around the $10,000 mark. Itâ€™s impressive, but in practice, the biggest challenge for Bitcoin was to grow from $0 to $100. 

It broke $1,000 in 2014 and reached an all-time high of $20,000 just three years later, at the end of 2017.

Bitcoin's price remains exceptionally volatile. Within nine months of its all-time high, the price had dropped back to $3,000. 

Even though Bitcoin has a close to 200 billion market cap, it's still common to see a daily price swing above five percent. 

The market cap of Bitcoin would need to hit the trillions before hype, panic, and large transactions would no longer affect the price.

Today, the perception of Bitcoin is very different from what it was 10 years ago. 

These days, nearly all mainstream financial channels regularly talk about Bitcoin. Wall Street and world leaders are all starting to take notice as well.

While the price reflects the market sentiment the technology around Bitcoin is being improved non-stop by engineers worldwide.

## 5. Why Bitcoin Growing

To understand what drives Bitcoin's growth, it's essential to look at Bitcoin as a social cause. 

The technology seeks to provide a solution to some major socioeconomic and geopolitical problems, rather than merely being a new asset class. 

> Bitcoin is not only an improvement on how we perform financial transactions and preserve wealth. It's a whole new way to own and exercise control over assets.

Unlike traditional financial instruments, which are generally imposed by governments or other centralized organizations, the core driving force of Bitcoin is its global community. 

In the face of modern-day problems like money printing, currency debasements, over-regulation, sanctioning, more people are moving towards Bitcoin. That trend in Bitcoin's popularity is likely to continue. 

A widespread availability of cryptocurrency exchanges amid economic issues worldwide made it easier for people to acquire Bitcoins.

## 6. Is Bitcoin Stoppable?

A lot of new people entering the Bitcoin ecosystem remain skeptical about its ability to succeed. 

The narrative is that one day Bitcoin (or a similar decentralized system) may replace centrally regulated financial institutions seems fanciful--- especially when the core beneficiaries of the current status quo are some of the most world's most powerful entities.

Many people also assume that governments are going to try banning Bitcoin. However, those beliefs are founded on a misunderstanding about how Bitcoin operates on a technical level.

> So, the real question, do governments (or other organizations) have the ability to stop Bitcoin?

Even if a government tries to outlaw Bitcoin, enforcing such a ban would be impossible. As long as there is electricity powering computers, phones, and other smart devices, the Bitcoin network can exist. 

Yes, lawmakers can make it more difficult for people to participate in the network, but that is the extent of their power.

Taking down the Bitcoin network would be more difficult than taking down the entire internet. 

While modern-day regulators are able to censor what is being seen on search engines, YouTube, or in mainstream media, censoring access to Bitcoin network is a new level of complexity.

The only way for the Bitcoin network to cease having any meaningful value is for everyone to stop using it. Such an outcome would only realistically occur if someone discovered an irreparable fundamental flaw in the code powering the Bitcoin network.

## 7. Bitcoin Problems

// speed and scalability
// certain form of centralization
// lack of know how
// lack of adoption
// lack of privacy

## 9. Bitcoin Forks

While learning about Bitcoin, crypto newcomers quickly discover about alternative cryptocurrencies. 

You can subdivide the various cryptocurrencies in following groups:

- Some portray themselves as a better alternative to Bitcoin when it comes to privacy or scalability aspects. As mentioned above Bitcoin is neither fully private nor currently capable of processing a lot of transactions. Cryptocurrencies like, [Dash](https://www.dash.org), [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org) or [Zcash](https://z.cash) try to excel in areas where Bitcoin currently lags.

- There are cryptocurrencies which emerged from the Bitcoin through a process knows as fork. These are known as "Bitcoin fork" cryptocurrencies and represent a different cryptocurrency and a different network. Mostly share a lof of fundamentals and have some differences. This group includes [Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoincash.org) and [Litecoin](https://litecoin-foundation.org).

- There is a number of major cryptocurrencies which represent all-purpose blockchains that go beyond payment transfers. The most notable examples are Ethereum and EOS cryptocurrencies.

- Finally, the largest segment of cryptocurrencies are known as tokens which are created on a blockchain like Ethereum. There are a number of widely used tokens which are created and successfully operate on top of Ethereum blockchain.

The original Bitcoin---created by Nakamoto---has the ticker symbol BTC. It's generally referred to as Bitcoin, or Bitcoin classic. You might also see it called Bitcoin Core, which is the name of the program used to run a Bitcoin node on a computer. 

The Bitcoin forks are cryptocurrencies which have split from the original Bitcoin. Due to the open-source nature of Bitcoin, anyone with programming experience can create a Bitcoin-esque cryptocurrency with some modifications, then market it as a separate cryptocurrency. 

The most noteworthy example is Bitcoin Cash. It managed to attract a significant community and gain significant market share. It actually emerged as a result of original Bitcoin community splitting into two camps in 2017.

In the ecosystem of cryptocurrencies the most valuable is usually considered to be the one with the largest network and community around it. Some cryptocurrencies may be very similar to Bitcoin and yet not able to compete with it price wise due to smaller network.

## 10. Storage & Usage

// refer to fundamentals (1-8)

## 11. Bitcoin Address Formats

// 44, 49, 84

## 12. Bitcoin Privacy 

Bitcoin is semi-private. Although all transactions in the Bitcoin network are public, they appear as a transaction from one Bitcoin address to another.

- there is no way to know the identity of the sender or recipient by looking at an individual transaction. The sender and the recipient can be the same person.

- by looking at addresses involved in transaction, it's possible to see other transactions where that address was involved in the past. 

- if the user always used the same address for incoming transactions, anyone could lookup all those different transactions on a blockchain and see that recipient is the same person.

- if the wallet user uses a new address for each new transaction, then linking various different transactions to the same entity becomes impossible.

Remember, this is an entry-level guide. It is not a complete picture of Bitcoin's privacy features. 

For someone with a large amount of Bitcoin, or living in a hostile environment, several other factors should be considered.

## Conclusion

That's about it! Now you know all the essential information about owning and using Bitcoin.
