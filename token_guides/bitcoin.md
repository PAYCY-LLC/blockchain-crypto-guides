# Bitcoin In Simple Terms

Crypto newcomers have a mountain of questions. 

- What is Bitcoin? 
- How does it work?
- What makes it special? 

The purpose of this guide is to answer those questions by introducing you to Bitcoin in simple terms and an easy-to-digest manner.

Over the last few years, Bitcoin network has been labeled in many ways. It's been called everything from electronic cash to digital gold.

While Bitcoin's definition may change depending whom you ask, it holds certain universal properties which gives Bitcoin its value. 

More and more people nowadays look at Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional wealth preservation instruments such as fiat money or precious metals.

## 1. Bitcoin Origins

The idea of Bitcoin was first proposed by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) back in 2008. Satoshi created a blueprint outlining the mechanics of a network where the value exchanging transactions can happen without the middle man. 

> The ideas put forward in the paper required a good understanding of the contemporary monetary system and graduate-level knowledge of mathematics, cryptography, and computer science. 
> 
> As such, you should regard Bitcoin as a scientific invention that challenges the hegemony of the present-day monetary and financial services where value exchange happens through a middle men.

In the paper, Satoshi proposed Bitcoin as a decentralized network which :

- not reliant upon any entity to function
- functional and accessible 24/7
- enforces equal rules for all participants
- available for anyone unconditionally

That's how the Bitcoin blockchain was born. After Bitcoin made its debut the underlying blockchain technology spread to other projects resulting in other cryptocurrencies and whole new systems.

Bitcoin was initially worthless; only a handful of people knew about it. In its early days, the public mostly perceived Bitcoin as fun money for geeks rather than as something that could challenge the financial system. 

The mainstream media played an influential role in shaping how the masses perceived Bitcoin in those first few years. 

Initially, nearly all media mentions of Bitcoin were negative. Indeed, the technology has been declared dead by various publications more than 400 times!

After a few years of growth via word-of-mouth marketing the Bitcoin turned into a massive phenomenon powered by a large network of users.

## 2. Bitcoin Cryptocurrency

As we have covered in our guide on blockchains, the cryptocurrency is a unit of measure on a blockchain. 

The Bitcoin cryptocurrency, denoted by a BTC symbol, is the native unit of measurement on Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoins are limited and scarce. Eventually, there will be 21 million Bitcoins in existence.

- Starting from early 2009, Bitcoin blockchain started functioning and every 10 minutes the program powering Bitcoin blockchain been adding certain amount of Bitcoins to the network. So far, almost 18 million Bitcoins have been released to the market.

- The network is designed so that a certain number of Bitcoins are added to the network every 10 minutes. Newly created Bitcoins are awarded to one of the nodes operating the Bitcoin network. 

- The award goes to the node that is the first to solve a mathematical problem successfully. Although all nodes are trying to solve it, only the first one gets the pay-out. The process of solving the mathematical problem is what essentially called as mining.

- The Bitcoin network will create the remaining three million Bitcoins over the next 130 years. 

No single entity controls the release of new Bitcoins into circulation. It's an automated process that's regulated by algorithms. The algorithms were coded into Bitcoin at the start of its existence.

It's estimated that about four million Bitcoins have been already "lost." Typically, coins are lost because users have lost the wallets with Bitcoins on them without having a backup. 

Out of 18 million Bitcoins created so far, only about 14 million are actually available for transacting.

## 4. Bitcoin As A Network

Usually, the term Bitcoin used as a reference to cryptocurrency on the Bitcoin network.

> However, the Bitcoin is not just cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a network, and an open platform for commerce where the value denominated in Bitcoins.

Bitcoin is essentially network consisting of:
 
 - parties running Bitcoin node software
 - people accumulating Bitcoin in wallets
 - traders trading Bitcoin on exchanges
 - engineers building services for Bitcoin

The entities above are essentially different members of the Bitcoin network. These are the people that drive the adoption and demand for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

> The systematic increase in the bitcoin price was ultimately due to the growing number of people interested in Bitcoin.

Anyone can join the Bitcoin network and start using it on equal terms as everyone else. 

Bitcoin users typically participate in the role of a wallet. They send and receive payments.

Some users participate by running one of the Bitcoin nodes hosting a live copy of the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
Bitcoin nodes are the entities which process and validate transactions from wallets, as they happen on the Bitcoin network. Moreover, nodes keep the full history of transactions since very beginning.

> The history of all Bitcoin transactions is also called the 'Bitcoin blockchain'. New transactions added to the history in blocks.
>
> The history of all Bitcoin transactions is a chain of blocks. The new block added roughly every 10 minutes.

Nodes are also tasked with validating every new transaction and ensuring that only legitimate transactions are added to the blockchain. 

Cumulatively, Bitcoin nodes guarantee the openness, availability, decentralization, and security of the Bitcoin network. 

There are at [https://bitnodes.io](least 10,000 Bitcoin nodes) powering the Bitcoin network at any given time. The nodes are spread around the world. All working for keeping Bitcoin network accessible and running 24/7.

Anyone can set up a node without much effort. The node doesn't require any maintenance and can even operate on an old computer.

Cumulatively, the nodes guarantee decentralization, availability, and security of the Bitcoin network.

- As long as at least one node is online, the Bitcoin network will remain accessible for transactions.
    
- The more nodes there are on the network, the harder it is for an entity to cheat. The other nodes would all work against it.
    
While all nodes on Bitcoin network are equal, some nodes may do more things than others. 

There are two main types:

- Full Nodes

    Full nodes keep a complete copy of the blockchain. Any full node can independently verify any transaction for validity.

- Miner Nodes

    All miner nodes continuously compete with each other to be the node that gets to add the next block to the blockchain. The miner node that is the first to solve a mathematical problem is the one that wins the associated Bitcoin reward. That's exactly how new Bitcoins added to circulation.

If you want to run a miner node for the sake of making some money, you need to consider the cost-efficiency of doing so. 

Making a profit from Bitcoin mining has become extremely difficult for single users due to widespread competition.

After taking electricity prices into account, you're very likely to lose money. Mining is generally only profitable for people running a large number of specialized computers and who are buying electricity at industrial rates in countries like China.

## 5. Bitcoin Price

Back in the first few years, the idea that Bitcoin would someday be worth thousands of dollars appeared outlandish. One early adopter famously spent 10,000 BTC (around $100,000,000 USD at current prices) on a single pizza.

> Fast-forward to June 2020, and Bitcoin is consistently trading around the $10,000 mark. Itâ€™s impressive, but in practice, the biggest challenge for Bitcoin was to grow from $0 to $100. 

It broke $1,000 in 2014 and reached an all-time high of $20,000 just three years later, at the end of 2017.

Bitcoin's price remains exceptionally volatile. Within nine months of its all-time high, the price had dropped back to $3,000. 

Even though Bitcoin has a 200 billion market cap, it's still common to see a daily price swing above five percent. 

The market cap of Bitcoin would need to hit the trillions before hype, panic, and large transactions would no longer affect the price.

Today, the perception of Bitcoin is very different from what it was 10 years ago. These days, nearly all mainstream financial channels regularly talk about Bitcoin. 

Wall Street and world leaders are all starting to take notice. It's no longer perceived as "fun money for geeks" but as a valuable financial asset. 

The current Bitcoin price, as well as the current market capitalization, is an indication of the new reality.

## 4. Why Bitcoin Growing

To understand what drives Bitcoin's growth, it's essential to look at Bitcoin as a social cause. 

The technology seeks to provide a solution to some major socioeconomic and geopolitical problems, rather than merely being a new asset class. 

> Bitcoin is not only an improvement on how we perform financial transactions and preserve wealth. It's a whole new way to own and exercise control over your assets.

Unlike traditional assets and financial instruments, which are generally enforced by governments or other centralized organizations, the core driving force of Bitcoin is its global community. 

In the face of modern-day problems such as excessive money printing, currency debasements, politically motivated sanctioning, a growing number of people are moving towards Bitcoin.

The growing trend in Bitcoin's popularity is likely to continue. 

Those that understand the changing reality are the ones who are trying to grow their Bitcoin holdings as quickly as possible.

## 5. Is Bitcoin Stoppable?

A lot of new people entering the Bitcoin ecosystem remain skeptical about its ability to succeed. 

The narrative that one day Bitcoin (or a similar decentralized system) may replace centrally regulated financial institutions seems fanciful--- especially when the core beneficiaries of the current status quo are some of the most world's most powerful entities.

Many people also assume that governments are going to try banning Bitcoin. However, those beliefs are founded on a misunderstanding about how Bitcoin operates on a technical level.

> So, the real question, do governments (or other organizations) have the ability to stop Bitcoin?

Even if a government tries to outlaw Bitcoin, enforcing such a ban would be impossible. As long as there is electricity powering computers, phones, and other smart devices, the Bitcoin network can exist. 

Yes, lawmakers can make it more difficult for people to participate in the network, but that is the extent of their power.

Taking down the Bitcoin network would be more difficult than taking down the entire internet. 

While modern-day regulators are able to censor what is being seen on search engines, YouTube, or in mainstream media, censoring people from Bitcoin network is a new level of complexity.

The only way for the Bitcoin network to cease having any meaningful value is for everyone to stop using it. Such an outcome would only realistically occur if someone discovered an irreparable fundamental flaw in the code powering the Bitcoin network.

## 6. Bitcoin Forks

While learning about Bitcoin, crypto newcomers quickly discover a large number of alternative cryptocurrencies already in existence. 

Many of them portray themselves as a better alternative to Bitcoin. Moreover, some of these cryptocurrencies have the word "Bitcoin" in their names. It only adds to the confusion.

 You can subdivide the various Bitcoin tokens in the following three ways:
 
- Bitcoin
    The original Bitcoin---created by Nakamoto---has the ticker symbol BTC. It's generally referred to as Bitcoin. You might also see it called Bitcoin Core.

- Bitcoin Forks: 
    In addition to Bitcoin itself, there are several other cryptocurrencies with Bitcoin in the name. They are called Bitcoin forks and are cryptocurrencies which were derived from the original Bitcoin (BTC). Due to the open-source nature of Bitcoin, anyone with programming experience can create a Bitcoin-esque cryptocurrency with some modifications, then market it as a separate cryptocurrency. The most noteworthy example is Bitcoin Cash.

The term altcoins refers to all other cryptocurrencies that exist. Although there are thousands in circulation, only a few have managed to attract an audience and gain significant market share. The altcoins which have not attracted any audience are generally regarded as coins with no value proposition and are labeled as "shitcoins."â€¨

## 8. Bitcoin Privacy 

Bitcoin is semi-private. Although all transactions in the Bitcoin network are public, they simply appear as a transaction from one Bitcoin address to another.

The image below shows a screenshot of a transaction from the BTC.com block explorer:

As you can see from the image, there is no way to know the identity of the sender or recipient by looking at an individual transaction. The sender and recipient could even be the same person.

That said, by clicking on the sender's address, it's possible to see which address the sender received the funds from. If the wallet user always uses the same address for incoming transactions, it would be easy to see all incoming transactions and build a comprehensive transaction history.

Conversely, if the wallet user uses a new address for each new transaction, then identifying the user's incoming transactions becomes close to impossible.

Remember, this is an entry-level guide. It is not a complete picture of Bitcoin's privacy features. For an advanced user with a large amount of Bitcoin, or for someone living in a hostile environment, several other factors should be considered.



## 10. Conclusion
