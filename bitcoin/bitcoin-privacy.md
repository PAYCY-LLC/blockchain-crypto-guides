# Bitcoin Privacy Explained

Bitcoin is semi-private. Although all transactions in the Bitcoin network are public, they simply appear as a transaction from one Bitcoin address to another.

The image below shows a screenshot of a transaction from the BTC.com block explorer:

As you can see from the image, there is no way to know the identity of the sender or recipient by looking at an individual transaction. The sender and recipient could even be the same person.

That said, by clicking on the sender's address, it's possible to see which address the sender received the funds from. If the wallet user always uses the same address for incoming transactions, it would be easy to see all incoming transactions and build a comprehensive transaction history.
