 Note: Bitcoin transactions are final. Once the Bitcoins are sent to the destination address and included in the block, they are non-reversible. Only the owner of the destination Bitcoin address can send or spend the Bitcoin.
How Fast Are Bitcoin Transactions?
What happens to a transaction after the user clicks on the Send button in the wallet? Well, every Bitcoin transaction goes through the following three stages:
1. Pending Phase
The pending phase occurs while the transaction is in progress.
1. A user clicks on the Send button in the wallet app.
2. The transaction reaches the nodes on the Bitcoin network.
3. Each node places the transaction in a queue, called a "mempool."
This phase should be almost instant in most wallets. At the end of the phase, network nodes have the transaction in the queue but not it in the blockchain (the global history of transactions) yet.
When the transaction is sent, the recipient will see it as pending in their local transactions list within a couple of seconds. While it remains pending, it's still technically possible for the sender to modify/cancel the transaction.
2. Confirmation Phase
The next phase happens when the transaction is added to the blockchain and is confirmed by nodes. That usually happens within 10 minutes but can take longer. There are two factors which can affect the amount of time for the transaction to be confirmed:
1. The transaction fee set by the sender.
2. The current number of pending transactions in the network.
When the number of transactions in the network exceeds the amount of transactions nodes can process, nodes get to choose which transactions to include first. In general, nodes give priority to transactions which pay the higher fee. Most wallet apps will take the current network conditions into account and recommend the optimal fee on the Send screen.

Final Phase
After the transaction is included in the block, it's safe to assume that it is complete. However, due to the nature of how the Bitcoin network operates, it's recommended to wait for between three to six blocks to pass before the transaction can be regarded as final and irreversible.
As soon as the transaction is included in the block, it's considered to have had one confirmation. When the blockchain adds another block on top of it, it's said to have received two confirmations, and so on.
Anyone can monitor the status of any transaction from the moment it was sent using a public block explorer site. In practice, this means that as soon as a user presses the Send button, the receiving party can monitor the transaction online and see how it's progressing. To do so, the receiver only needs the ID number of the transaction. You can obtain it from the wallet.
