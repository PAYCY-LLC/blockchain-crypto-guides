A better breed of non-custodial wallets like Unstoppable Wallet work in a peer to peer manner and do not rely on any 3rd party managed servers. This basically means that user activity within the app is private and not being logged on some servers.




### Loosing Your Device
   Keeping your non-custodial Ethereum wallet on your phone is handy. Your cryptocurrency remains close, easy to access, and you can make changes, sales, and payments wherever you are. But what happens if you lose your smartphone? Could someone steal your cryptocurrency if they find your smartphone?
   Android and iOS have security features that will protect against smartphone loss or theft. For the most part, you are relying on integrated smartphone security features. 
   In recent times, Apple has shown that iOS is a very secure mobile operating system, with extensive security and privacy features. Android is a different proposition because it operates across so many different smartphone brands and models while retaining the same functionality. Android's universal approach means that, inevitably, some Android devices become vulnerable over time as the devices can no longer receive the latest security updates. 
   For the most part, iOS and Android security revolve around your device lock mechanism. Modern devices usually combine two factors for better security, such as a PIN and a biometric lock (like a fingerprint or face scan). 
   If your smartphone has no PIN or another locking mechanism in place, your phone is vulnerable. Presuming a thief knows what they're looking for---cryptocurrency wallets, exchange apps, and so on---they could clean out your Ethereum and other cryptocurrency accounts. 
   So, what happens if you lose your smartphone? This is where your 12-word private key comes into play, and why it is so important to keep the private key safe. In the event you lose your smartphone, you can recover the wallet to a new device using the private key, then transfer the funds to a new wallet address.
