## 5. Spending Bitcoin

The ability to pay with Bitcoin in stores remains uncommon. While some merchants like Whole Foods are slowly starting to accept payments in Bitcoin, the vast majority of retailers are still not on board. 

There are many reasons for the lack of adoption, ranging from the absence of legal guidelines for merchants to the technical architecture of the Bitcoin blockchain.

However, there are already some reliable ways to spend your cryptocurrency. For example, some companies provide branded debit cards which can be used to pay anywhere that either Visa or MasterCard is accepted. 

You pay with a card as you would normally do, and the amount is deducted from your crypto wallet balance using current market rates.

 Below, you will see some of the more popular providers of such cards. 
 
 Most are only available to people living in the US or Europe. They all require the user to provide some identification documents.

When using the services, the card provider will issue you with a crypto wallet. It will be a custodial wallet and, therefore, you should never keep too much funds on it.

To reiterate---use a non-custodial wallet for your primary funds and occasionally top up the wallet provided by card provider with small amounts. Think of it as a prepaid debit card.

At the end of the day, you get to protect your wealth and have access to it whenever needed.
