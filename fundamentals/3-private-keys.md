# Private Keys Explained

As we have explained in the previous section, non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets enable safe storage of the cryptographic keys that have control over the coins on the wallet's balance.

This cryptographic key is usually referred to as private key. So, when you hear a term private key keep in mind that it's the key with unconditional control over the funds.

> The private key is never meant to be shared. You should NEVER share it with anyone. 
>
> Quite often scammers impersonate support teams and trick users looking for help into sharing private keys and then steal the funds on the balance. Keep that in mind.

Any non-custodial wallet should provide means for the user to access and view that key from the wallet app. If that option isn't there then there is a good chance that the wallet is a custodial one.

To make it easier for the average person to handle the private key engineers came up with a way to convert that key to plain set of 12 regular words. So, most of the non-custodial wallets will display the private key in a form of 12 or 24 words.

The user needs to have access to that private key in order to be able to restore the access to the wallet if for some reason the wallet device is no longer there. This can happen if the say user's phone with a mobile wallet on it gets stolen.

## Private Key Essentials

Here are some essential things you should know about the private key.

// can be one key for mutliple coins

// should be securely generated

   When you first create a non-custodial wallet, the code powering the wallet randomly generates a secure Private Key. 
   
   That private key is essentially a key to the funds on your wallet and must never be revealed or published. Next to that Private Key, the wallet generates a Public Key which is used to generate payment addresses where users can receive funds.
   Any entity which has access to the private key has full access to funds in the wallet; it can be considered the wallet's owner.
   Custodial wallets do not provide the user with the private key. The wallet operator has full control over the assets. 
   Non-custodial wallets provide the private key to users. The user has full control of the wallet's assets. 
   Your cryptocurrency wallet private key is usually presented in a form of a series of 12 or more words. The 12 words are a "human-readable" representation of the private key. 
   The image above shows a sample private key from the Unstoppable Bitcoin Wallet. The wallet associated with the key does not have any funds in it. If it did have funds, anyone reading this guide could import the key on a wallet app, access the wallet, and transfer the funds elsewhere.

// should obey standards

 Nearly all non-custodial wallets provide an Import (or Restore) wallet feature. It enables anyone to enter an existing private key and restore access to the wallet's funds. Some of the best non-custodial wallet apps are built in a way where you can easily import/restore keys that were generated in other wallets. In other words, when you use such a wallet you can easily migrate all your funds from one non custodial wallet to the other, built by different entity.
   The feature means that even if your phone breaks or the wallet app stops working, your funds are still safe; you will always be able to restore access to your Ethereum and other crypto funds using the private key the wallet generated. There are no time frames---the same key would work years later. 
   It is clear, therefore, that safely storing your private key is extremely important. Failure to do so could result in a loss of your assets. If you lose the key or unknowingly expose it to someone, they can get control of your Bitcoin. That's the only thing you need to understand. The rest is secondary.
   
   
   
   ### Loosing Your Device
   Keeping your non-custodial Ethereum wallet on your phone is handy. Your cryptocurrency remains close, easy to access, and you can make changes, sales, and payments wherever you are. But what happens if you lose your smartphone? Could someone steal your cryptocurrency if they find your smartphone?
   Android and iOS have security features that will protect against smartphone loss or theft. For the most part, you are relying on integrated smartphone security features. 
   In recent times, Apple has shown that iOS is a very secure mobile operating system, with extensive security and privacy features. Android is a different proposition because it operates across so many different smartphone brands and models while retaining the same functionality. Android's universal approach means that, inevitably, some Android devices become vulnerable over time as the devices can no longer receive the latest security updates. 
   For the most part, iOS and Android security revolve around your device lock mechanism. Modern devices usually combine two factors for better security, such as a PIN and a biometric lock (like a fingerprint or face scan). 
   If your smartphone has no PIN or another locking mechanism in place, your phone is vulnerable. Presuming a thief knows what they're looking for---cryptocurrency wallets, exchange apps, and so on---they could clean out your Ethereum and other cryptocurrency accounts. 
   So, what happens if you lose your smartphone? This is where your 12-word private key comes into play, and why it is so important to keep the private key safe. In the event you lose your smartphone, you can recover the wallet to a new device using the private key, then transfer the funds to a new wallet address.
