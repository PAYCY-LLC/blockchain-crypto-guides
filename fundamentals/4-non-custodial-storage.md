# Non-Custodial Wallets

By this time you should have a solid understanding of:

* the importance of the private keys
* the difference between custodial and non-custodial wallets

Furthermore, it should be clear that non-custodial wallet is the only option for a long term storage. 

In this section we are going to look at different types of non-custodial wallets and go over the most popular ones.

The first thing to keep in mind there is no such thing as the most suitable wallet for all. Certain non-custodial wallets may be more appropriate for some and not for others. It depends on things like:

* the place user lives in
* familiarity with blockchain security
* familiarity with digital security
* the amount of crypto the wallet to store
* whether the person is a potential target
* how frequently the wallet to be accessed

Some wallets are more user-friendly and appropriate for new people with a crypto capital below 50-100K. At the same time, for people with a crypto capital in millions and extensive security knowledge the requirements for the wallets are higher. Those people may prefer and infact advocate to use wallets engineered for higher security needs.

In this section we will try to look at common non-custodial wallets and get a balanced overview of the security aspects. A balanced approach involves a tiered approach, where the higher security requirements introduced as the risk factor grows. So, an ideal wallet for someone new in crypto with 10K capital is not the same as for someone in space for years and capital over 100K.

As the user's crypto capital grows so does the potential cost of loosing it. In such cases the capital might be divided into multiple wallets, where a larger chunk kept with extra secure considerations in mind while the remaining in potentially less secure but easily accessible wallet. 

## Non-custodial Wallet Types

All non-custodial wallets out there provide users with full control over the crypto. That's an underlying characteristic of such a wallet. 

That said, depending on the type of non-custodial type there may be elements in the wallet architecture which may affect the safe-storage of the private key.

For instance, ensuring a safe storage of the private key in an up-to-date iOS / Android based wallet is easier than say on a desktop based wallet running on all-purpose Windows computer that's few generations behind.

There 3 main types of non-custodial wallets:

1. hardware wallets designed for cold storage
2. mobile application wallets
3. desktop-based software wallets

The above mentioned non-custodial wallets generally differ in the extent to which private keys are protected. Some are designed taking into account even the most unlikely scenarios.

### Hardware Wallets

The hardware wallets usually come in a form of small hardware devices resembling USB thumb drives and engineered for the sole purpose of storing large amount of cryptocurrencies securely.

Without going into technicals, it's enough to know that these devices are widely considered as ones with the highest level of security. The security considerations are built around the idea of making the extraction of private keys impossible, even if the attacker actually has the wallet device in physical possession.

From usability point of view hardware wallets are somewhat more difficult to use than other non-custodial wallets. It's not very difficult for someone familiar person familiar with ins and outs of crypto but definitely not as easy for those new to the field.

Generally speaking, for someone with a large amount of crypto assets (> $ 50,000) it would be advisable to jump on a hardware wallet directly. Or at the very least start exploring these wallets with the intent to move a larger chunk of their assets into a hardware wallet in the future.

Two well-known hardware wallet providers are:

- https://trezor.io
- https://www.ledgerwallet.com

Both companies have a wide range of products to choose from. It's important to buy those directly from the provider's website.

Those with smaller sums at starting time can consider starting with more convenient options and adjust later on.

### Mobile Wallets

The mobile based wallets for iOS and Android are the most common type of non-custodial wallets. These wallets are generally more user-friendly and usually designed for those looking for the full control over the assets but at the same time just getting to know how crypto works.

Some of our favorites are:

- https://unstoppable.money
- https://brd.com

Many of these wallets may and perhaps even do claim to provide same level of security as a hardware wallet. 

However, the main point for you to understand here is that there are significantly more ways to attack a wallet running on a mobile operating system then say a small hardware device designed to do one small thing and nothing else. 

That's because mobile wallets operate on an all-purpose operating system (iOS, Android) with a lot of software components. The smartphone device itself is a complex device that depends on a lot of mechanical parts. There may be an issue somewhere in the architecture that no one have discovered yet.

While engineers may do their best to build a safe wallet there may be an undiscovered issue somewhere in the operating system or hardware components of the phone that can potentially endanger the security of the private key.

These days, both Google's Android and Apple's iOS operating system come with so called 'secure element' which is specifically designed for handling highly sensitive data. The storage of data in that secure element is meant for keeping the data secure even of the phone ends up in the hands of someone looking to extract that data.

A good non-custodial wallet adheres to the standards recommended by the underlying operating systems and best practices documented by engineers worldwide. Most non-custodial wallet keep their code public allowing third-party engineers to evaluate it.

So, a good non-custodial wallet created per recommended standards is likely to be very secure, just may not be as secure as the hardware wallet.

### Desktop Wallets

Desktop wallets are less secure when compared to a desktop based wallet for the same reason why a mobile wallet is less secure than a hardware wallet. The potential attack surface on a desktop operating system is even larger than that of mobile. That's just the nature of the desktop platform.

That said, it doesn't necessarily mean some desktop wallet is less secure than some mobile-based wallet just because of the platform. There are a lot of factors to consider that has to do with how the wallet was engineered.

Some of the more popular desktop-based wallets are:

- https://electrum.org
- https://www.exodus.io/bitcoin-wallet

## The Right Wallet For You

The classification above was primarily based around the notion of private key security. While it's the most important factor it should not be the only one when choosing the right wallet for yourself.

For instance, a non-custodial mobile-wallet may be potentially be more private than a hardware wallet. Or have helpful features not available in the hardware wallet.

As mentioned earlier, a balanced approach is a tiered one, where the higher security requirements are introduced as the risk factor grows.

The absolute minimum requirements from any non-custodial wallet should be:

- ability to migrate to another third-party wallet 
- inbuilt security to prevent unauthorized access
- adherence to engineering best practices

On a practical level, below we define risk in terms of the capital amount to be stored on the wallet. Approach it as a third party opinion and ultimately use your own judgement to figure out the best strategy for yourself. It should give you an idea about how to choose the right wallet and yet not worry about potential security issues. 

### For Capital < $ 10,000

Those making their way into cryptocurrency for the first time are likely to find the mobile-based non-custodial wallets easier to use.

Keeping your mobile wallet on your phone is handy. Your cryptocurrency remains close, easy to access, and you can make changes, sales, and payments wherever you are. 

As long as you have a backup of the private key you should be good to go. When choosing a wallet make sure:
 
 - it's possible to migrate private key to other wallets and access funds from there
 - there are internal measures that prevent someone accessing funds if the phone is lost or stolen.

Both Android and iOS have security features that will protect against smartphone loss or theft. Good wallets integrate these features. It's basically tied to the idea of using the PIN lock on your phone as a requirement for unlocking the phone.

If your smartphone has no PIN or another locking mechanism in place, your phone is vulnerable. Presuming a thief knows what they're looking for---cryptocurrency wallets, exchange apps, and so on---they could clean out your cryptocurrency accounts.

### For Capital > $ 10,000

As your capital grows, and you become comfortable dealing with cryptocurrency you can start looking at improving your overall security.

The basic principle can be based around the concept of keeping a larger portion of your holdings in a hardware wallet that's not meant to be accessed frequently. The rest can be kept in a mobile based wallet that can be easily accessible on demand.

> Keep in mind, regardless of whether you use a mobile on a hardware-based non-custodial wallet it's absolutely essentially to have a backup of the private key, which presented to the user in a form of 12/24 English words. 
>
> Storing this words safely is critical. If someone finds it, your wallet can be emptied even if the person doesn't have access to the device.
>
> The hardware wallet itself and its backup key should be stored in separate locations.

When setting up a new wallet some wallet apps enable users to set a password next to 12 words as an additional recovery requirement. This allows the person to keep the 12 words separately from the password and by doing so remain safe even if someone finds the list with written words. The password can be memorized as well.

If the sum to be stored in the hardware wallet is substantial then as a further precaution it's advised to split between two or more hardware wallets and place them in different locations.

## Conclusion

If you have a basic understanding of what has been covered by now you already know quite a lot!

The previous sections were meant to give you basic and yet fundamental overview about holding cryptocurrencies.

The aim was to illustrate that non-custodial wallet type is the only wallet that can guarantee the ownership of the coins. 

Therefore, should you start accumulating cryptocurrencies use a non-custodial wallet for storage. 

Do not ever keep a substantial amount on wallets that are not non-custodial. Wallets provided by cryptocurrency exchanges are custodial and can censor or block the funds should there ever be a need for that.
