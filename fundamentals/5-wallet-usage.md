# Wallet Know-How

By now it's clear, cryptocurrency wallets come in various types. 

It's been said that only non-custodial wallets enable exclusive ownership of the funds.

Next step is to actually get the wallet and go through 'things to know' when using the wallet app.

## Purpose Of Your Wallet

Those holding crypto in a million range should move major chunk of the capital to a hardware wallet.

Don't keep everything in one wallet. It can be divided into three wallets as below:  

- 1-5% in everyday wallet
- 10-20% in investment wallet
- rest stored in a hardware storage

All three wallets need to be properly backed up as was recommended earlier.

The crypto that's meant for active investments like trading on exchanges or investment in other tokens can be kept on mobile non-custodial wallet.

The Unstoppable Wallet is being specifically build with the active investor in mind. This wallet is built by Horizontal Systems, the company behind these guides. 

There are other non-custodial mobile wallets as well, like BRD Wallet and Exodus Wallet.
