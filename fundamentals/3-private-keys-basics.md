# Private Keys

So, by now you know the basics behind blockchains, cryptocurrencies and wallets. 

As we have explained, genuine cryptocurrency wallets store cryptographic keys that have control over certain amount of cryptocurrency.

From that cryptographic key the wallet app can understand the amount of cryptocurrency user owns as well as past transactions. This cryptographic key is usually referred to as private key. 

> The wallet app is an instrument that essentially stores your private key. This private key is what gives you control over certain amount of cryptocurrency.
>
> The non-custodial wallet app uses private key to retrieve balance and past transactions from the blockchain.

To keep this guide simple we are not going to explain how the private keys work under the hood. Just know that a term private key usually refers to a cryptographic key we talked about earlier.

Below, we are going to be looking a bit deeper into security aspects to give you a better understanding of private keys, and the related security aspects.

## 1. Keep Key Private

Quite often scammers (by impersonating wallet support teams) trick users into sharing their private keys. When the user shares the key the scammer steals the funds on the balance. 

> There is absolutely no valid reason for you as a wallet app user to ever share the private keys with anyone. This applies to all wallets.
>
> Never reveal your private key to anyone, even when you're communicating with people who built your wallet app.

You may reveal your private key to someone only when you intentionally want to pass the ownership of your funds to that person.

Any non-custodial wallet provides means for the user to access and view private key from within the wallet app.

## 2. Backup Key

Most non-custodial wallet apps show the private key during the wallet app setup. The wallet app usually prompts user to write down the private key and store it somewhere safely offline.
 
> The private key is the only way to restore access to funds in case the device with the wallet app become inaccessible i.e. if it gets stolen or simply stops working.

To make it easier for the average person to backup the private key, blockchain engineers came up with a way to convert the private key to a plain set of 12 or 24 regular words. 

Most non-custodial wallets will display the private key in a human-readable form, generally in a form 12/24 words.

Backup the private key and make sure there are no typos in your backup. Other than actual words, the ordering is just as important. 

> If you lose or unknowingly expose the private key to someone, they can get control of your crypto. That's the only thing you need to understand when it comes to private keys.

The 12/24 words should be backed up in the correct order. A non-custodial wallet may understand if you make a typo in one of the words and show an appropriate warning. 

If the words positioned incorrectly a non-custodial wallet will still restore some random wallet, it just won't be yours. So, the correct order is just as important.

## 3. Private Key Generation

When you first setup a non-custodial wallet app, the code powering the wallet app randomly generates a secure Private Key for you.

For the private key to be truly secure it's important for a wallet app to generate a private key which is truly random. If it's not random it's potentially not as safe.

That's one of the reasons why non-custodial wallets keep the code open. Third-party engineers can then analyze the code and check whether the wallet app generates private key correctly.

There are websites like [WalletScrutiny.com](https://walletscrutiny.com) which exist to ensure wallets published on Google Play in fact use the same code as the code publicly shared with the community.

> If the private key generated by a non-custodial wallet is not random then the wallet is not safe.
   
There are well documented manuals for engineers describing how to do that on a platform on which the wallet is built for. Any good non-custodial wallet app is built in accordance with those standards.

## 4. One Key, Many Coins

So, now you know what a private key is and how it's generated. 

Another essential aspect, a single private key can be used to control balances for multiple cryptocurrencies. When using such key the wallet apps can locate the balances for all supported cryptocurrencies.

For instance, when creating the wallet on [Unstoppable wallet](https://unstoppable.money) user gets a single private key for 5 cryptocurrencies:

- Bitcoin
- Dash
- Bitcoin Cash
- Litecoin
- Ethereum

The same private is used to control multiple cryptocurrencies, each with its own balance.

## 5. Balances & Transactions

As was mentioned above there are 'private key' standards designed by engineers throughout the years. These standards define how exactly wallet apps should handle the private key for use with multiple cryptocurrencies. 

> The wallet uses your private key to derive your payment address for each cryptocurrency. The payment address is the address you are sharing with others that want to pay you in cryptocurrency.

Just by looking at your private key the wallet app should be able to derive your address for Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other cryptocurrencies. Different address for each cryptocurrency.

When you import the private key to another standard-compliant wallet that other app will also derive same addresses.

That's basically how a wallet app can take a private key used on another app, and from that key restore balances and transactions for multiple cryptocurrencies

> If a private key was initially generated in standard-compliant manner, then any other standard-compliant wallet should be able to derive payment addresses and past transactions for each supported cryptocurrency. 

Once the app knows the addresses for say Bitcoin, it connects to the Bitcoin blockchain and looks for transactions involving those addresses. 

As a result of that process the wallet app can display the balances and past transactions associated with that private key.

## 6. Moving Between Wallets

Moreover, good non-custodial wallets enable private key migration between wallets. 
 
A private key created on one non-custodial wallet can be used (restored) in another non-custodial wallet. 

> This means that the user is not restricted to a single wallet provider and may easily migrate between non-custodial wallets built by different parties. 

If your phone breaks, or the wallet app stops working, your funds are still safe; you will always be able to restore access to your crypto funds using the private key the wallet generated. 

There are no time frames---the same key would work years later.

Not all non-custodial wallets provide an Import (or Restore) wallet feature. 

When choosing a wallet you should look for one that's standard compliant in that regard and supports import/export of private keys.

A good breed of non-custodial wallet handle private keys in a way where a person can easily migrate to another wallet and vice versa.

> Note: When migrating your private key from one wallet to another you need the destination wallet to support all cryptocurrencies that private key controls. 

If your private key has some balance on Bitcoin and Ethereum but the destination wallet supports only Bitcoin then your Ethereum balance won't be visible. It will still be yours and accessible from some other wallet.
