# Getting Crypto

Assuming you have a basic understanding of what cryptocurrencies are, let's look int various ways of acquiring crypto.

At this point we are learning the essentials and therefore we'll not cover all possible ways to obtain cryptocurrencies but the more obvious ones.

So, there are several ways:

- buying with credit card
- buying on regulated exchange
- getting paid in crypto
- buying with cash
- buying on decentralized exchange

## Buying Using Card

The easiest option for buying smaller amounts is using a credit or debit card. While the option to buy cryptocurrency is convenient, you often pay a slight premium for the privilege. 

The following list contains recommendations of safe websites and services to purchase cryptocurrency using a credit or debit card.

4. https://www.coinbase.com/
5. https://www.coinmama.com/buy
6. https://www.bitpanda.com/en/prices

The majority of these sites will work without fail for EU and US residents. However, those living in other areas of the world may find fewer opportunities.

## Buying Crypto On Exchange

If you plan to cryptocurrency regularly, you should consider signing up to and using an exchange. A cryptocurrency exchange will usually feature a more competitive price than a straight credit card. 

A cryptocurrency exchange lists thousands of different cryptocurrencies which you can then trade for fiat currency or other cryptos. 

Trading on an exchange may sound confusing if you have never traded stocks or currencies, but it isn't difficult once you get into the swing of things. 

Cryptocurrency exchanges must adhere to local currency dealing laws. Financial regulations vary from country to country, so not all exchanges are available around the globe, and others cannot offer the same range of products in certain locations. 

Most cryptocurrency exchanges will practice Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks before allowing you to make your first cryptocurrency purchase.

The KYC/AML regulations aren't just for the big exchanges. Smaller exchanges and even some peer-to-peer crypto vendors practice these regulations to ensure they are not handling stolen fiat currency or engaging with identity fraud.

With this in mind, the process for purchasing cryptocurrency on an exchange usually follows a similar process to this:

1. Create an account
2. Verify your identity
3. Transfer funds to your exchange account
4. Purchase cryptocurrency
5. Transfer your cryptocurrency to a non-custodial wallet for safety

The amount you can purchase on an exchange usually changes depending on the level of verification. 

For example, if you sign-up and verify your email address on an exchange, you can purchase $500-$1000 worth of Bitcoin. However, if you sign-up, verify your email address, add an official ID document, and verify your address, you can purchase a lot more. While this is a fictional example, many exchanges use a similar tiered approach to user verification.

## Getting Paid In Crypto

It's not uncommon these days for online freelancers to accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. If you provide some kind of services online look for the ways to accept payments in cryptocurrencies. Such options might be already present in the platform being used. 

There are also free DIY solutions if you familiar with programming. Or turnkey third party solutions like the one from Coinbase, https://commerce.coinbase.com.

Finally, you can just always use a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet to receive payments directly.

## Buying With Cash (or via P2P platform)

If you know someone who would be willing to sell some crypto then buying it with cash is not a bad idea. 

For that you only need a non-custodial wallet. Send your 'receive' address to the person and wait for the cryptocurrency to arrive. Wait for the transaction to complete (will be covered later) and then pass the cash to the person. 

There are also P2P platforms like https://localbitcoins.com that connect buyers and sellers from different regions. Such platforms might be useful in regions where access to regulated exchanges is not an option. While a lot of people seem t be using those platforms note that there is a lot of risks. 

It's hard to know whether the selling party is a legit one and not a scammer trying to cheat you.

## Buying on Decentralized Exchange

Decentralized exchanges are fairly new phenomena. Just like the cryptocurrency itself, decentralized exchanges utilize the blockchain technology to provide a platform for crypto exchange.

For the most part such exchanges operate in a peer to peer manner where buyer and seller are connected to complete the purchase. 

Such exchanges do not require verification of any kind. There are no limitations in the amount that can be sold or purchased.

At this point in time it's fairly difficult for a beginner level user to participate in those. So, we are going to be looking at them in detail later on.
