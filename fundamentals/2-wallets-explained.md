# Crypto Ownership

By its very nature cryptocurrency gives the owner capabilities that are not available with traditional financial instruments. Thus, it's vital for someone to understand what these capabilities are, and the responsibilities that come with that.

When dealing with traditional financial instruments such us cash funds in the bank accounts (or stocks with the broker) there is a notion of someone keeping assets on behalf of the user. While it may seem the notion of full control over the assets is there in reality it's not. The bank can go bankrupt as a result of bank run, or freeze customers' funds, etc. The exception are things like cash and physically held assets like gold.

When it comes to cryptocurrencies the owner of the funds is the entity that controls those funds without the middlemen. This is one of the core principles behind classical cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

For someone looking to safely store and subsequently accumulate crypto assets it's important to know how that exclusive ownership works and what it actually means to own cryptocurrency.

Unfortunately, a lot of people enter the space and start accumualating cryptocurrencies without understanding these fundamentals. This exposes them to risks that cryptocurrencies were supposed to protect them from.

## How Ownership Works

Generally speaking, most cryptocurrencies operate on top of the blockchain that powers that specific cryptocurrency. For instance, Bitcoin is the native currency of the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum crypto currency has its own blockchain and so on. These blockchains are separate entities and not really related although might be quite similar in many underlying technological aspects.

The notion of someone owning Bitcoin or Ethereum is quite different from the idea of traditional cash in your wallet or even bank account. The ownership in cryptocurrency means the ownership of special cryptographic key which has a power to spend a certain amount of crypto. 

So, when someone says s/he has 5 Bitcoins what this essentially means is that this person is in the possession of the cryptographic key that can spend 5 Bitcoins.

And when that person sends 1 Bitcoin to someone the sender uses his/her key to sign off 1 Bitcoin from the available balance and pass the ownership to the cryptographic key of the recipient. After the transaction has taken place (i.e. was added to history of records), that 1 Bitcoin can only be spent by the key of the recipient.

So, the takeaway point here is that the ownership of certain amount of crypto basically means the ownership of special cryptographic key.

Under the hood it may look something like this:

Revealing this cryptographic key to someone or loosing it essentially means loosing access to the balance. Note that it's impossible for someone(even the most powerful computer in the world) to guess that key, even if it tries to do it over a billion years.

In a way, the private key can be thought of as a secure alternative to traditional username/password authentication method.

## Cryptocurrency Wallets

In essence, cryptocurrency wallets are merely the instruments meant to hold and manage such cryptographic keys. These wallets do not physically store cryptocurrencies, instead wallets store cryptographic keys which can exercise over certain amount of cryptocurrencies.

Genuine cryptocurrency wallets enable safe and private storage of above mentioned cryptographic keys.

We deliberately said "genuine" wallets because cryptocurrency wallets come in many forms. Building genuine wallet is significantly more difficult and thus most wallet providers build pseudo currency wallet that do not provide users with a genuine control over the assets.

Even the 'genuine wallets' themselves can vary significantly in terms of how secure or private wallet is. 

While there are a lot of things that can potentially be taken into account when it comes evaluating wallets in this section we are going to focus on the core principle. The unconditional ownership!

### The Absolute Minimum

The minimum requirement for any decent wallet should be full unconditional ownership by the user over the funds the wallet holds.

Not all wallet are equal in that regard. Depending on how the wallet built, and the ideological beliefs of the entity behind it the wallet may either provide full unconditional ownership over the crypto, partial or none at all.

### 1) Non-Custodial Wallets

A non-custodial wallet type gives the user exclusive control over their funds. The entity providing the wallet does not have any control over the user assets. 

A non-custodial wallet is theoretically the most secure form of a cryptocurrency wallet as no third-party can interfere with the security measures in place with the wallet.

Such wallets known as "trustless" as the user doesn't have to trust any entity with his/her funds. Moreover, non-custodial wallets generally keep the wallet code open to the public for scrutiny.

Usage of such a wallet requires the basic understanding that the funds are under exclusive control of the user. It should be further noted that there is no insurance when using such a wallet. User gets full control and responsibility when dealing with crypto assets on the wallet.

This is the only type of wallet we recommend for safe storage. In the later sections we are going to look deeper into the differences between various non-custodial wallets.

### 2) Custodial Wallets

A custodial wallet does not give the user exclusive control over the crypto funds on the wallet. A wallet provider basically gives "pseudo" wallet that shows balance and whenever user executes a transaction it's the wallet provider who sends those funds on user's behalf from some other wallet. 

Such wallets are the least secure wallets. The users' funds are fully in the hands of the wallet provider. A provider may easily block a user from accessing the wallet or even freeze the funds. Unlike banks which also act as a middleman wallet providers are not financial institutions and thus not as regulated. So, there is a lot of risk there, especially for users holding large amounts.

Furthermore, custodial wallets are not private as the provider knows full transaction history of the user.

Do not trust custodial wallets with substantial sums.

Most cryptocurrency exchanges provide users with custodial wallets. So, it's not advised to use those as "safe storage".

If you leave funds on exchange, or any type of custodial wallet, the funds are vulnerable to hacking or other types of data breaches involving the cryptocurrency exchange. This happened a lot in the past and likely to keep happening in the future. 

There is also the question of censorship. While your funds remain on the exchange, the exchange could feasibly freeze your funds, restrict your usage, or even block you from your account without warning.

Most of the popular wallet out there are unfortunately of custodial nature.

### 3) Hybrid Wallets

Hybrid wallets are rarer than a custodial or non-custodial wallet and offer a different take on asset ownership. Neither the wallet owner or the wallet provider has full control over the wallet funds. A hybrid wallet programmed to require approval from both parties before the funds can be spent. 

The hybrid wallet system protects against hacking but opens the door for the wallet provider to censor the user in certain scenarios.

To sum up, always look for non-custodial wallets. When using such a wallet you can be sure the funds are indeed under your control and not dependent on any third party.
