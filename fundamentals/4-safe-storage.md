# Non-Custodial Wallets

By this time you should have a solid understanding of:

* the importance of the private keys
* that non-custodial wallet is the only option for a long term storage

In this section we are going to look at different types of non-custodial wallets.

Keep in mind, there is no such thing as the most suitable wallet for all. Certain non-custodial wallets may be more appropriate for some and not for others. It depends on things like:

* the place user lives in
* familiarity with blockchain security
* familiarity with digital security
* the amount of crypto the wallet to store
* whether the person is a potential target
* how frequently the wallet to be accessed

Some wallets are more user-friendly and appropriate for new people with smaller balances. At the same time, for people with a crypto capital in millions and extensive security knowledge the expectations from wallets are considerably higher. Those people may prefer and infact advocate to use wallets engineered for higher security needs.

In this section we will try to look at common non-custodial wallets and get a balanced overview of the security aspects. 

A balanced approach involves a tiered approach, where the higher security requirements introduced as the risk factor grows. An ideal wallet for someone new with a capital below 10K is not the same as for someone in space for years and capital over 100K.

As the user's crypto capital grows so does the potential cost of loosing it. In such cases the capital might be divided into multiple wallets, where a larger chunk kept with extra secure considerations in mind while the remaining in potentially less secure but easily accessible wallet. 

## Non-custodial Wallet Types

All non-custodial wallets out there provide users with full control over the crypto. That's an underlying characteristic of such a wallet. There 3 main types of non-custodial wallets:

1. hardware wallets 
2. mobile application wallets
3. desktop-based software wallets

Non-custodial wallets potentially differ in the extent to which wallet private keys are protected. Some are designed taking into account even the most unlikely scenarios.

Depending on the wallet type there may be elements in its architecture which may affect the safe-storage of the private key. 

For instance, ensuring a safe storage of the private key in an up-to-date iOS or Android based wallet is easier than on a desktop wallet running on all-purpose Windows computer that's few generations behind.

### 1. Hardware Wallets

The hardware wallets usually come in a form of small hardware devices resembling USB thumb drives and engineered for the sole purpose of storing large amount of cryptocurrencies securely.

Without going into technicals, it's enough to know that these devices are widely considered as ones with the highest level of security. The security considerations are built around the idea of making the extraction of the private keys impossible, even if the attacker has the wallet device in physical possession.

From usability point of view hardware wallets are somewhat more difficult to use than other non-custodial wallets. It's not very difficult for someone familiar with ins and outs of crypto but definitely not as easy for those new to the field.

Generally speaking, for someone with a large amount of crypto assets ( > $ 50,000) it would be advisable to use the hardware wallet. Or at the very least start exploring these wallets with the intent to move a chunk of their assets to a hardware wallet in the future.

Two well-known hardware wallet providers are:

- https://trezor.io
- https://www.ledgerwallet.com

Both companies have a wide range of products to choose from. It's important to buy those directly from the provider's website.

### Mobile Wallets

The mobile based wallets for iOS and Android are the most common type of non-custodial wallets. These wallets are generally more user-friendly and usually designed for the new comers getting to know how crypto works.

Some of our favorites are:

- https://unstoppable.money
- https://brd.com
- https://www.exodus.io

From security point of view, the main point here is that there are more ways to attack a wallet running on a mobile operating system then a small hardware device that is designed to do one small thing. 

Mobile wallets operate on an all-purpose operating system (iOS, Android) with a lot of software components. The smartphone device itself has a lot of hardware components that potentially open up new attack surfaces.

Both Google's Android and Apple's iOS operating system come with so called 'secure element' which is specifically designed for handling highly sensitive data. The storage of data in that secure element is meant for keeping the data secure even of the phone ends up in the hands of someone looking to extract sensitive data.

A good non-custodial wallet likely to adhere to the standards recommended by the operating systems and best practices documented by the engineers worldwide. 

Most non-custodial wallet keep their code public allowing third-party engineers to evaluate it.

### Desktop Wallets

Desktop wallets are theoretically less secure when compared to a desktop based wallet for the same reason why a mobile wallet is less secure than a hardware wallet. 

The potential attack surface on a desktop operating system is even larger than that of mobile. That's just the nature of a desktop platform.

It doesn't necessarily mean some desktop wallet is less secure than some mobile-based wallet just because of the platform. There are a lot of factors to consider that has to do with how the wallet was engineered.

Some of the more popular desktop-based wallets are:

- https://electrum.org
- https://www.exodus.io

## So, Which Wallet?

The classification above was primarily based around the notion of private key security. While it's the most important factor it should not be the only one when choosing the wallet.

For instance, a non-custodial mobile wallet app may potentially be more private than a hardware wallet. Or have helpful features not available in the hardware wallet.

The minimum requirements for mobile non-custodial wallet should be as follows.
 
- Security Basics

    The owner of the device should have a basic understanding of digital security. For instance, if it's a smartphone wallet it's important for a mobile OS to stay up to date. The use of unauthorized applications on the phone is not advised. 
 
- Standard Private Keys

    The wallet should generate private keys in a standard manner. This will allow for seamless migration to a third party wallet should there ever be a need for that.

- Unauthorized Access Measures
    
    The smartphone access should be protected with the PIN. Presuming a thief knows what they're looking for---cryptocurrency wallets, exchange apps, and so on---they could clean out your cryptocurrency accounts there is no PIN on the smartphone. The same applies to the PIN lock on the hardware wallet.
        
## Grow With Risks

When your crypto capital is small stick to standard measures but as the capital grows become more demanding. You don't need cartel level security if you're just starting out. The out of the box security on most non-custodial wallets is already pretty good.

> A balanced approach is a tiered one, where the higher security requirements are introduced as the risk factor grows.

Below we define risk in terms of the capital amount. It should give you an idea how to choose the wallet and not worry too much about security issues. 

> Disclaimer: Ultimately use your own judgement to figure out the best strategy for yourself)

### For Capital < $ 50,000

Those making their way into cryptocurrency for the first time are likely to find mobile-based wallets easier to use.

Keeping your mobile wallet on your phone is handy. Your cryptocurrency remains close, easy to access, and you can use funds to invest, make payments wherever you are. 

As long as you have properly backed up the private key and have a PIN lock on the app you should be good to go. 

When it comes to hiding the backup of the private keys, some people prefer to write them down on a piece of paper and store them somehow somewhere. Some prefer encrypt the text using standard methods and store it online.

> Note that it's not a good idea to have a digital version of the private key for any wallet with large amount of crypto. For smaller amounts should not be an issue as such as long as you understand the risks. 

For mobile non-custodial wallets that are meant to be accessed frequently go with 12/24 words backup. Make sure it's stored safely and easily accessible on demand. 

### For Capital > $ 50,000

As your capital grows, and you become comfortable dealing with cryptocurrency start looking at improving your overall security.

The basic principle can be based around the concept of keeping a larger portion of your holdings in a hardware wallet that's not meant to be accessed frequently. 

The rest can be kept in a mobile based wallet that can be easily accessible on demand.

If the sum to be stored in the hardware wallet is substantial then as a further precaution it's advised to split between two or more hardware wallets.

## Wallet Backups

When setting up new wallets some wallet apps enable users to add a password next to 12/24 words.

It's an additional security measure that allows the person to keep the 12/24 words separately from the password and by doing so remain safe even if someone finds the list with words. The password will be needed to access crypto funds.

The password can be memorized or written down and kept separately from the list of words. Think of this a way to upgrade the security of your funds.

However, adding password next to 12/24 words to some extent limits the options when it comes to migrating to a third party wallet in the future.

### Keeping Backups Safe

Keep in mind following when keeping your private key backups offline:

- private key should be kept in separate location from wallet app or device.
- if the private key consists of 12/24 words and a password, the words should be kept separately from a password.
- take precautions against fire or floods.
- private key backup or wallet device can potentially be found by someone else.

For private key backups for hardware wallets with large sums it's recommended to set up private in a form of '12/24 words + password'. That option available on all hardware wallets. Those wallets enable creating and restore of such private keys.

A backup of words can be stored in a metal container from Crypto Steel (link below). The additional password that was set up along with words should be kept separately.

As a result you end up with:

1. wallet device (protected by PIN)
2. words list (protected by metal case)
3. password that's needed for words list to work

If all three items are stored separately you are achieving a fairly good level of crypto security. To access your funds you will either need a wallet device + pin, or the private key + password.

It's also advised to share enough information with your close ones so that they can recover the access to funds should for some reason you become unreachable.

## Conclusion

If you have a basic understanding of what has been covered by now you already know quite a lot!

The previous sections were meant to give you basic and yet fundamental overview about holding cryptocurrencies.

The aim was to illustrate that non-custodial wallet type is the only wallet that can guarantee the ownership of held cryptocurrencies. 

Therefore, should you start accumulating cryptocurrencies use a non-custodial wallet for storage. 

Do not ever keep a substantial amount on wallets that are not non-custodial. Wallets provided by cryptocurrency exchanges are custodial and can censor or block the funds should there ever be a need for that.

Those holding large amounts of crypto, should consider putting the sum not meant to be accessed frequently on a hardware wallet.
