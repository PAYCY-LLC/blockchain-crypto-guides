# Getting A Wallet

By now you understand that non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets come in various types. 

Next step is to go through 'things to know' when using the wallet app.

While all non-custodial wallets built around the core principle of exclusive control over funds, on the surface the wallets may vary substantially.

The wallet built for an active investor may differ substantially from a wallet built for someone with long term accumulation and extensive privacy requirements. 

From user's perspective, along with the ability to independently store and transact with cryptocurrencies, the basic expectations from any wallet should be:

- wallet app should generate private keys in a standard-compliant manner. As a result, the user not restricted to a specific wallet to access owned cryptocurrency.

- wallet supporting multiple cryptocurrencies should correctly manage the incoming payment addresses for each cryptocurrency. For example, the user's address for receiving payments in Bitcoin varies from the address for receiving Ethereum.

- It's generally expected from a wallet to check whether the destination payment address is a valid address for that specific currency. In other words, if the user mistakenly tries to send Bitcoins to some Ethereum address the wallet app should prevent that.

## Unstoppable Intro

These guides are for someone looking to invest in cryptocurrencies on an ongoing basis. Thus, moving forward we are going to focus on the needs of those users.

We are going to use Unstoppable non-custodial wallet to illustrate things you should know when interacting with wallets.

Below are key features the investor-type users should expect from their wallet app.

### 1. Backup / Restore 

Every non-custodial wallet starts either with the process of new wallet setup or migration of existing wallet.

- The 'Create Wallet' wallet button generates a new private key in a form of 12 words which needs to be backed up.
- The 'Restore Wallet' option restores an existing wallet that might have been created in unstoppable or some other standard compliant wallet. That process may take a few hours to complete.

### 2. PIN Lock Security

It's important for any non-custodial wallet app to come with inbuilt unauthorized access measures. 

Both mobile and hardware wallets implement that in a form of unlock code which is required in order to access the wallet.

This measure is essential to keep your funds safe even when an unauthorized entity gets your wallet device.

### 3. Multiple Cryptocurrencies
       
The more currencies the wallet able to store the better.

It's a matter of convenience interacting with one app rather than switching between many apps for different cryptocurrencies.

### 4. Historical Prices

It's important the wallet displays current as well as historical market exchange rates for each supported cryptocurrency.

The current rates are necessary for the wallet to calculate and display your asset balance in currency you're used to (like USD). Also for sending payments in cryptocurrency by entering the amount in fiat currency.

Sending someone 100$ worth of Bitcoin is not easy when you try to do the math in your head).

### 5. Coin Overviews

Each cryptocurrency is essentially a project with its own set of specifics. 

While there are a lot of different cryptocurrencies there is lack of well-researched information describing these projects in accessible manner. Due to the young nature of the industry most projects are fairly obscure even for the experienced newcomers with a technical background.

An investor-friendly wallet app should provide detailed information about the project.

What each project is about, problems its trying to address, where currently at and how far has it progressed.

There is a strong need for the educational content on pretty much every aspect of the cryptocurrenceies and blockchain ecosystem. 

### 6. Movement Alerts

### 7. Privacy

It should further be noted that best non-custodial wallets are able to restore balance/transactions directly from the blockchain without relying on an intermediary server. 

This ensures that wallet app can connect to one of thousands of servers powering any given blockchain and download your history from it rather than requesting it from a third party server which at some point can become unreachable.
