# Getting A Wallet

By now it should be clear that non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets come in various types. 

Next step is to go through 'things to know' when using the wallet app.

While all non-custodial wallets built around the core principle of exclusive control over funds, on the surface the wallets may vary substantially.

The wallet built for an active investor may differ substantially from a wallet built for someone with extensive privacy requirements. 

From user's perspective, the basic expectation from any given wallet is the ability to independently store, send and receive the cryptocurrencies the wallet supports.

- A wallet should generate private keys in standard-compliant manner. That ensure that a wallet user is not tied to use a specific wallet to be able to access and manage your cryptocurrency.

- A wallet supporting multiple cryptocurrencies should correctly manage the "receive" address for each cryptocurrency. For example, the wallet user's address for receiving payments in Bitcoin varies from the address for Ethereum.

- A wallet app is expected to check whether the payment is being sent to a 'valid' address. In other words, if the user mistakenly tries to send a Bitcoin payment to some Ethereum address the wallet app should be able to alert the user accordingly. The funds sent to an incorrect address are not recoverable.

## Unstoppable Intro

These guides were written for someone looking to invest in cryptocurrencies on an ongoing basis. So, moving forward we are going to focus on those planning to invest and grow cryptocurrency portfolio.

We are going to use Unstoppable non-custodial wallet to illustrate things you should know when interacting with wallets.

Below are key features the investor-type users should expect from their wallet app.

### 1. Backup / Restore 

Every non-custodial wallet starts either with the process of new wallet setup or migration of existing wallet.

- The 'Create Wallet' wallet button generates a new private key in a form of 12 words which needs to be backed up.
- The 'Restore Wallet' option restores an existing wallet that might have been created in unstoppable or some other standard compliant wallet. That process may take a few hours to complete.

### 2. PIN Lock Security

It's important for any non-custodial wallet app to come with inbuilt unauthorized access measures. 

Both mobile and hardware wallets implement that in a form of unlock code which is required in order to access the wallet.

This measure is essential to keep your funds safe even when an unauthorized entity gets your wallet device.

### 3. Multiple Cryptocurrencies
       
The more currencies the wallet able to store the better.

It's a matter of convenience interacting with one app rather than switching between many apps for different cryptocurrencies.

### 4. Historical Prices

The wallet should display current and historical market exchange rates for each supported cryptocurrency.

The current rates are necessary for the wallet to calculate and display your asset balance in currency you're used to (like USD) but also for sending payments in cryptocurrency by entering the amount in fiat currency.

Sending someone 100$ worth of Bitcoin is not easy if you don't know the current Bitcoin price.

### 5. Cryptocurrency Info

Each cryptocurrency is essentially a project with its own set of specifics. 

While there are a lot of different cryptocurrencies out there the amount of well researched information describing these projects is limited. Due to the young nature of the industry most projects are fairly obscure even for the experienced newcomers.

Understanding problems each cryptocurrency project aims to solve on a practical level is key.

An investor-friendly wallet app should provide detailed information about the project. the user should be able to understand what the project is about, where it's currently at, what kind of compeeting products are out there and so on.

It's critical for anyone looking to invest in cryptocurrencies over the long term to be able to identify the good, the bad and the ugly.

### 7. Privacy

It should further be noted that best non-custodial wallets are able to restore balance/transactions directly from the blockchain without relying on an intermediary server. 

This ensures that wallet app can connect to one of thousands of servers powering any given blockchain and download your history from it rather than requesting it from a third party server which at some point can become unreachable.
