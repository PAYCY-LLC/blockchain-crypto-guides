# Getting A Wallet

By now it's clear, cryptocurrency wallets come in various types.

Next step is to actually get the wallet and go through 'things to know' when using the wallet app.

## Purpose Of Your Wallet

As have been repeatedly mentioned those holding crypto valued over $ 50,000 should consider major chunk of the capital to a hardware wallet. At least the chunk that's not meant for frequent use.

Depending on the amount consider dividing the capital into multiple wallets as below. 

- generic wallet : 

    mobile non-custodial wallet that always with you and stores smaller amounts for all-purpose transactions. 
    
- investment wallet : 

    mobile non-custodial wallet that keeps the capital meant for active investments. Doesn't need to be accessed as frequently but potentially can be if you're an active investor buying and selling cryptocurrencies ona regular basis.
    
- storage wallet : 

    hardware holds crypto meant for long term storage.

All three wallets need to be properly backed up following the steps recommended earlier.

### Backup / Restore 

- the process will start with some kind of key backup
- understand BIPs
- restore works

It should further be noted that best non-custodial wallets are able to restore balance/transactions directly from the blockchain without relying on a intermediary server. 

This ensures that wallet app can connect to one of thousands of servers powering any given blockchain and download your history from it rather than requesting it from a third party server which at some point can become unreachable.
