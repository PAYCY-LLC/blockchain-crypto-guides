Ethereum Privacy Explained

In the case of Bitcoin blockchain the address for receiving payments can change (but don’t have to) with each transaction. Keeping privacy in mind, most Bitcoin wallets generate a new address after each incoming payment making it considerably more difficult to connect two different transactions to a single party.

When it comes to Ethereum blockchain your address to receive Ether payments will always be the same. Nearly all Ethereum wallets work this way nowadays. This is likely to change in the future but for the time being that’s how most Ethereum wallets work. The wallets generate and use a single Ethereum address. There are other technical reasons for that.
The balance and transactions originating to/from specific payment addresses are stored in a visible manner on Ethereum blockchain.


The key takeaway point here is that Ethereum blockchain is fully transparent allowing anyone to see all incoming/outgoing transactions for the given payment address. On the other hand, when it comes to Bitcoin blockchain the relationship between transactions breaks when a user uses a new payment address for each incoming payment. 

As a result, in its current state, Bitcoin transactions in wallets provide users with more privacy than Ethereum transactions in that same wallet. 

The only thing that adds some minimal privacy element into the mix is the fact there is no way to check who that address belongs to. On the other hand, when you’re sending/receiving Ether, keep in mind that the other party can look up your balance as well as history of incoming/outgoing payments to/from that address.
With enough time and resources, someone could feasibly link certain transactions to individual users. If one of the cryptocurrency exchanges gets hacked and hackers get their hands on user data, this would potentially mean that someone can map Ethereum payment addresses to real world identities.
